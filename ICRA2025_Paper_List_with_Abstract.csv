SLAM 1,Measurement Simplification in Rho-POMDP with Performance Guarantees,"Yotam, Tom;Indelman, Vadim","Keywords: SLAM, Motion and Path Planning, Autonomous Agents, Foundations of Automation","Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty is at the heart of any autonomous system acting with imperfect information. The cost of solving the decision making problem is exponential in the action and observation spaces, thus rendering it unfeasible for many online systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to efficient decision-making, by partitioning the high-dimensional observation space. Using the partitioned observation space, we formulate analytical bounds on the expected information- theoretic reward, for general belief distributions. These bounds are then used to plan efficiently while keeping performance guar- antees. We show that the bounds are adaptive,
computationally efficient, and that they converge to the original solution. We extend the partitioning paradigm and present a hierarchy of partitioned spaces that allows greater efficiency in planning. We then propose a specific variant of these bounds for Gaussian beliefs and show a theoretical performance improvement of at least a factor of 4. Finally, we compare our novel method to other state of the art algorithms in active SLAM scenarios, in simulation and in real experiments. In both cases we show a sign",,,,,,
SLAM 1,VSS-SLAM: Voxelized Surfel Splatting for Geometally Accurate SLAM,"Chen, Xuanhua;Zhang, Yunzhou;Zhang, Zhiyao;Wang, Guoqing;Zhao, Bin;Wang, Xingshuo","Keywords: Deep Learning Methods, Mapping, SLAM","Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) helps robots estimate their poses and perceive the environment in unknown settings. Recent work has demonstrated that implicit neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer higher fidelity scene representation than traditional map representations. We propose VSS-SLAM, which utilizes voxelized surfels as the map representation for incremental mapping in unknown environments. This representation effectively addresses the issue of redundant and disordered primitives encountered in previous methods, thereby enhancing geometric accuracy during reconstruction. Specifically, our approach divides the scene using voxels and stores geometric and appearance information in feature vectors at the voxel vertices. Before rendering, these feature vectors are decoded to generate the corresponding surfels. Additionally, we align camera poses through image and depth rendering. Extensive experiments on the Replica and TUM RGBD datasets demonstrate that VSS-SLAM delivers high-fidelity reconstruction and accurate pose estimation in both simulated and real-world environments. Source code will soon be available.",,,,,,
SLAM 1,New Graph Distance Measures and Matching of Topological Maps for Robotic Exploration,"Morbidi, Fabio","Keywords: Mapping, Autonomous Agents, SLAM","Abstract: Comparing graph-structured maps is a task of paramount importance in robotic exploration and cartography, but unfortunately the computational cost of the existing similarity measures, such as the graph edit distance (GED), is prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we introduce and characterize three new graph distance measures which satisfy the requirements for a metric. The first one, ""LogEig"", computes the square root of the sum of the squared logarithms of the generalized eigenvalues of the shifted Laplacian matrices associated with the two graphs, while the second calculates the Bures distance between these positive definite matrices. The third distance, ""Rank"", computes the rank of the difference of the graph shift operators associated with the two graphs, e.g. the adjacency or the Laplacian matrix. Examples and numerical experiments with graphs from a publicly-available dataset, show the accuracy and computational efficiency of the new metrics for 2D topological-map matching, compared to the GED. The effect of spectral sparsification on the new graph distance measures is examined as well.",,,,,,
SLAM 1,EnvoDat: A Large-Scale Multisensory Dataset for Robotic Spatial Awareness and Semantic Reasoning in Heterogeneous Environments,"Nwankwo, Linus Ebere;Ellensohn, BjÃ¶rn;Dave, Vedant;Hofer, Peter;Forstner, Jan;Villneuve, Marlene;Galler, Robert;Rueckert, Elmar","Keywords: Data Sets for SLAM, Data Sets for Robotic Vision, Semantic Scene Understanding","Abstract: To ensure the efficiency of robot autonomy under diverse real-world conditions, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset is essential to benchmark the operating algorithms' performance and robustness. Current benchmarks predominantly focus on urban terrains, specifically for on-road autonomous driving, leaving multi-degraded, densely vegetated, dynamic and feature-sparse environments, such as underground tunnels, natural fields, and modern indoor spaces underrepresented. To fill this gap, we introduce EnvoDat, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset collected in diverse environments and conditions, including high illumination, fog, rain, and zero visibility at different times of the day. Overall, EnvoDat contains 26 sequences from 13 scenes, 10 sensing modalities, over 1.9TB of data, and over 89K fine-grained polygon-based annotations for more than 82 object and terrain classes. We post-processed EnvoDat in different formats that support benchmarking SLAM and supervised learning algorithms, and fine-tuning multimodal vision models. With EnvoDat, we contribute to environment-resilient robotic autonomy in areas where the conditions are extremely challenging. The datasets and other relevant resources can be accessed through https://linusnep.github.io/EnvoDat/.",,,,,,
SLAM 1,Probabilistic Degeneracy Detection for Point-To-Plane Error Minimization,"Hatleskog, Johan;Alexis, Kostas","Keywords: SLAM, Probability and Statistical Methods","Abstract: Degeneracies arising from uninformative geometry are known to deteriorate LiDAR-based localization and mapping. This work introduces a new probabilistic method to detect and mitigate the effect of degeneracies in point-to-plane error minimization. The noise on the Hessian of the point-to-plane optimization problem is characterized by the noise on points and surface normals used in its construction. We exploit this characterization to quantify the probability of a direction being degenerate. The degeneracy-detection procedure is used in a new real-time degeneracy-aware iterative closest point algorithm for LiDAR registration, in which we smoothly attenuate updates in degenerate directions. The method's parameters are selected based on the noise characteristics provided in the LiDAR's datasheet. We validate the approach in four real-world experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods at detecting and mitigating the adverse effects of degeneracies. For the benefit of the community, we release the code for the method at: github.com/ntnu-arl/drpm.",,,,,,
SLAM 1,SCE-LIO: An Enhanced Lidar Inertial Odometry by Constructing Submap Constraints,"Sun, Chao;Huang, Zhishuai;Wang, Bo;Xiao, Mancheng;Leng, Jianghao;Li, Jiajun","Keywords: SLAM, Mapping, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: In lidar-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, loop closure detection is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of odometry. However, constraints from loop closure detection are only provided when a loop is detected and can only enhance odometry accuracy at specific moments. Therefore, this paper proposes a lidar inertial odometry system that
periodically provides submap constraints to the pose graph and enhances odometry accuracy through pose graph optimization. In the process of creating submap constraints, the system represents lidar keyframes as a collection of submaps containing overlapping information. The optimal pose transformations between submaps, determined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm with point-to-line and point-to-plane methods, are recognized as submap constraints. During the backend optimization phase, submap constraints and adjacent lidar keyframe constraints are integrated into the pose graph.
The pose graph is then optimized using the pose graph optimization method to achieve the optimal lidar pose estimation. Additionally, To further enhance pose estimation, point-to-plane correspondence is established by considering the differences in normal vectors of feature points between the scan and the map, and integrated initial positioning module is created by incorporating preintegration and scan-to-scan matching. The results of simulation, public datasets and vehicle experiments show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is significantly improved compared to the advanced SLAM algorithm.",,,,,,
SLAM 1,HDPlanner: Advancing Autonomous Deployments in Unknown Environments through Hierarchical Decision Networks,"Liang, Jingsong;Cao, Yuhong;Ma, Yixiao;Zhao, Hanqi;Sartoretti, Guillaume Adrien","Keywords: AI-Based Methods, View Planning for SLAM, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HDPlanner, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework designed to tackle two core and challenging tasks
for mobile robots: autonomous exploration and navigation, where the robot must optimize its trajectory adaptively to achieve the task objective through continuous interactions in unknown environments. Specifically, HDPlanner relies on novel hierarchical attention networks
to empower the robot to reason about its belief across multiple spatial
scales and sequence collaborative decisions, where our networks decompose long-term objectives into short-term informative task assignments and informative path plannings. We further propose a contrastive learning-based joint optimization to enhance the robustness
of HDPlanner. We empirically demonstrate that HDPlanner significantly outperforms state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines on an extensive set of simulations, including hundreds of test maps and
large-scale, complex Gazebo environments. Notably, HDPlanner achieves real-time planning with travel distances reduced by up to 35.7% compared to exploration benchmarks and by up to 16.5% than navigation benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate our approach on hardware, where it
generates high-quality, adaptive trajectories in both indoor and outdoor environments, highlighting its real-world applicability without
additional training.",,,,,,
3D Content Capture and Generation 1,WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions Via Gaussian Splatting,"Qian, Chenghao;Guo, Yuhu;Li, Wenjing;Markkula, Gustav","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Computer Vision for Transportation, Visual Learning","Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and rain streaks in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,
3D Content Capture and Generation 1,RL-GSBridge: 3D Gaussian Splatting Based Real2Sim2Real Method for Robotic Manipulation Learning,"Wu, Yuxuan;Pan, Lei;Wu, Wenhua;Wang, Guangming;Miao, Yanzi;Xu, Fan;Wang, Hesheng","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Sim-to-Real refers to the process of transferring policies learned in simulation to the real world, which is crucial for achieving practical robotics applications. However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot simto-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. Then utilizing a GS editing approach to synchronize the rendering with the physics simulator, RL-GSBridge could reflect the visual interactions of the physical robot accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real experiments, including grasping and pickand-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D GS reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.",,,,,,
3D Content Capture and Generation 1,High-Quality 3D Creation from a Single Image Using Subject-Specific Knowledge Prior,"Huang, Nan;Zhang, Ting;Yuan, Yuhui;Chen, Dong;Zhang, Shanghang",Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation,"Abstract: In this paper, we address the critical bottleneck in robotics caused by the scarcity of diverse 3D data by presenting a novel two-stage approach for generating high-quality 3D models from a single image. This method is motivated by the need to efficiently expand 3D asset creation, particularly for robotics datasets, where the variety of object types is currently limited compared to general image datasets. Unlike previous methods that primarily rely on general diffusion priors, which often struggle to align with the reference image, our approach leverages subject-specific prior knowledge. By incorporating subject-specific priors in both geometry and texture, we ensure precise alignment between the generated 3D content and the reference object. Specifically, we introduce a shading mode-aware prior into the NeRF optimization process, enhancing the geometry and refining texture in the coarse outputs to achieve superior quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches. Our approach is well-suited for applications such as novel view synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D, particularly in the robotics field where diverse 3D data is essential.",,,,,,

3D Content Capture and Generation 1,LiDAR-EDIT: LiDAR Data Generation by Editing the Object Layouts in Real-World Scenes,"Ho, Shing-Hei;Thach, Bao;Zhu, Minghan","Keywords: Computer Vision for Transportation, Data Sets for Robotic Vision, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real Lidar scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

3D Content Capture and Generation 1,TICMapNet: A Tightly Coupled Temporal Fusion Pipeline for Vectorized HD Map Learning,"Qiu, Wenzhao;Pang, Shanmin;Zhang, Hao;Fang, Jianwu;Xue, Jianru","Keywords: Mapping, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Visual Learning","Abstract: High-Definition (HD) map construction is essential for autonomous driving to accurately understand the surrounding environment. Most existing methods rely on single-frame inputs to predict local map, which often fail to effectively capture the temporal correlations between frames. This limitation results in discontinuities and instability in the generated map.To tackle this limitation, we propose a textit{Ti}ghtly textit{C}oupled temporal fusion textit{Map} textit{Net}work (TICMapNet). TICMapNet breaks down the fusion process into three sub-problems: PV feature alignment, BEV feature adjustment, and Query feature fusion. By doing so, we effectively integrate temporal information at different stages through three plug-and-play modules, using the proposed tightly coupled strategy. Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not rely on camera extrinsic parameters, offering a new perspective for addressing the visual fusion challenge in the field of object detection. Experimental results show that TICMapNet significantly improves upon its single-frame baseline model, achieving at least a 7.0% increase in mAP using just two consecutive frames on the nuScenes dataset, while also showing generalizability across other tasks.

Widely used structure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately tracking the camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene content and the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motion masks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation and statics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Our novel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updating the pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimation quality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the training process. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamic datasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoN improves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and trajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research in this area.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Tactile Sensing 1,TransForce: Transferable Force Prediction for Vision-Based Tactile Sensors with Sequential Image Translation,"Chen, Zhuo;Ou, Ni;Zhang, Xuyang;Luo, Shan",Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing,"Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) provide high-resolution tactile images crucial for robot in-hand manipulation. However, force sensing in VBTSs is underutilized due to the costly and time-intensive process of acquiring paired tactile images and force labels. In this study, we introduce a transferable force prediction model, TransForce, designed to leverage collected image-force paired data for new sensors under varying illumination colors and marker patterns while improving the accuracy of predicted forces, especially in the shear direction. Our model effectively achieves translation of tactile images from the source domain to the target domain, ensuring that the generated tactile images reflect the illumination colors and marker patterns of the new sensors while accurately aligning the elastomer deformation observed in existing sensors, which is beneficial to force prediction of new sensors. As such, a recurrent force prediction model trained with generated sequential tactile images and existing force labels is employed to estimate higher-accuracy forces for new sensors with lowest average errors of 0.69N (5.8% in full work range) in x-axis, 0.70N (5.8%) in y-axis, and 1.11N (6.9%) in z-axis compared with models trained with single images. The experimental results also reveal that pure marker modality is more helpful than the RGB modality in improving the accuracy of force in the shear direction, while the RGB modality show better performance in the normal direction.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Tactile Sensing 1,HumanFT: A Human-Like Fingertip Multimodal Visuo-Tactile Sensor,"Wu, Yifan;Chen, Yuzhou;Zhu, Zhengying;Qin, Xuhao;Xiao, Chenxi","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Multi-Modal Perception for HRI, Soft Sensors and Actuators","Abstract: Tactile sensors play a crucial role in enabling robots to interact effectively and safely with objects in everyday tasks. In particular, visuotactile sensors have seen increasing usage in two and three-fingered grippers due to their high-quality feedback. However, a significant gap remains in the development of sensors suitable for humanoid robots, especially five-fingered dexterous hands. One reason is because of the challenges in designing and manufacturing sensors that are compact in size. In this paper, we propose HumanFT, a multimodal visuotactile sensor that replicates the shape and functionality of a human fingertip. To bridge the gap between human and robotic tactile sensing, our sensor features real-time force measurements, high-frequency vibration detection, and overtemperature alerts. To achieve this, we developed a suite of fabrication techniques for a new type of elastomer optimized for force propagation and temperature sensing. Besides, our sensor integrates circuits capable of sensing pressure and vibration. These capabilities have been validated through experiments. The proposed design is simple and cost-effective to fabricate. We believe HumanFT can enhance humanoid robots' perception by capturing and interpreting multimodal tactile information.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Tactile Sensing 1,FeelAnyForce: Estimating Contact Force Feedback from Tactile Sensation for Vision-Based Tactile Sensors,"Shahidzadeh, Amir Hossein;Caddeo, Gabriele Mario;Alapati, Koushik;Natale, Lorenzo;Fermuller, Cornelia;Aloimonos, Yiannis","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating 3D contact forces using vision-based tactile sensors. In particular, our goal is to estimate contact forces over a large range (up to 15 N) on any objects while generalizing across different vision-based tactile sensors. Thus, we collected a dataset of over 200K indentations using a robotic arm that pressed various indenters onto a GelSight Mini sensor mounted on a force sensor and then used the data to train a multi-head transformer for force regression. Strong generalization is achieved via accurate data collection and multi-objective optimization that leverages depth contact images. Despite being trained only on primitive shapes and textures, the regressor achieves a mean absolute error of 4% on a dataset of unseen real-world objects. We further evaluate our approach's generalization capability to other GelSight mini and DIGIT sensors, and propose a reproducible calibration procedure for adapting the pre-trained model to other vision-based sensors. Furthermore, the method was evaluated on real-world tasks, including weighing objects and controlling the deformation of delicate objects, which relies on accurate force feedback.",,,,,,

As humans, we rely heavily on tactile information to understand objects in our environments and how to interact with them. We use touch not only to perform manipulation tasks but also to learn how to perform these tasks. Therefore, to create robotic agents that can learn to complete manipulation tasks at a human or super-human level of performance, we need to properly incorporate tactile information into both skill execution and skill learning. In this paper, we investigate how we can incorporate tactile information into imitation learning platforms to improve performance on manipulation tasks. We show that incorporating visuo-tactile pretraining improves imitation learning performance, not only for tactile agents (policies that use tactile information at inference), but also for non-tactile agents (policies that do not use tactile information at inference). For these non-tactile agents, pretraining with tactile information significantly improved performance (for example, improving the accuracy on USB plugging from 20% to 85%), reaching a level on par with visuo-tactile agents, and even surpassing them in some cases.

However, the reliance on existing in-situ calibration methods for accurate force measurements limits their cost-effective and flexible applications. This article proposes a new in-situ calibration scheme that relies only on comparing contact deformation. Based on the detailed derivations of the normal contact and torsional contact theories, we designed a simple and low-cost calibration device, EasyCalib, and validated its effectiveness through extensive finite element analysis. We also explored the accuracy of EasyCalib in the practical application and demonstrated that accurate contact distributed force reconstruction can be realized based on the mechanical parameters obtained. EasyCalib balances low hardware cost, ease of operation, and low dependence on technical expertise and is expected to provide the necessary accuracy guarantees for wide applications of visuotactile sensors.",,,,,,

Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow.

By employing a non-dimensionalization framework and deep reinforcement learning, we systematically assessed how robot size and surface orientation affect landing capabilities. We hypothesized that maintaining geometric proportions across different robot scales ensures consistent perching behavior, which was validated in both simulation and experimental tests. Additionally, we investigated the effects of joint stiffness and damping in the landing gear on perching behaviors and performance. While joint stiffness had minimal impact, joint damping ratios influenced landing success under vertical approaching conditions. The study also identified a critical velocity threshold necessary for successful perching, determined by the robot's maneuverability and leg geometry. Overall, this research advances robotic perching capabilities, offering insights into the role of mechanical design and scaling effects, and lays the groundwork for future drone autonomy and operational efficiency in unstructured environments.",,,,,,

The work consists of the development of the Gannet Solar-VTOL, a waterproof small-UAS that is capable of resting on the surface of water for prolonged periods of time and over varying temperature ranges, while harvesting solar power to recharge itself. Equally importantly, it integrates a field-proven Self-Sustainable Autonomous System architecture that allows it to hibernate and sustain its battery charge overnight or during periods of solar illumination scarcity, as well as to assess mission-critical parameters (e.g., water surface turbulence, ambient temperature of battery compartment) on the low-power side of the Power Management Stack, and react appropriately. Finally, the robot is equipped with an onboard camera and a Neural Processing Unit that allows it to perform in-field environmental monitoring operations (e.g., wildfire detection). This paper experimentally demonstrates the aforementioned capabilities, and concludes with a presentation of the amphibious small-UAS' long-term deployment within a marine environment in the N.Nevada region, spanning over 3 consecutive days.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots 1,Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking,"Pal, Srijan Kumar;Sharma, Shashank;Krishnakumar, Nikil;Hong, Jiarong","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Perception and Autonomy, Reinforcement Learning, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: This paper presents a novel autonomous drone-based smoke plume tracking system capable of navigating and tracking plumes in highly unsteady atmospheric conditions. The system integrates advanced hardware and software and a comprehensive simulation environment to ensure robust performance in controlled and real-world settings. The quadrotor, equipped with a high-resolution imaging system and an advanced onboard computing unit, performs precise maneuvers while accurately detecting and tracking dynamic smoke plumes under fluctuating conditions. Our software implements a two-phase flight operation: descending into the smoke plume upon detection and continuously monitoring the smoke's movement during in-plume tracking. Leveraging Proportional IntegralÂ–Derivative (PID) control and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controller enables adaptation to plume dynamics. Unreal Engine simulation evaluates performance under various smoke-wind scenarios, from steady flow to complex, unsteady fluctuations, showing that while the PID controller performs adequately in simpler scenarios, the DRL-based controller excels in more challenging environments. Field tests corroborate these findings. This system opens new possibilities for drone-based monitoring in areas like wildfire management and air quality assessment. The successful integration of DRL for real-time decision-making advances autonomous drone control for dynamic environments.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots 1,EvMAPPER: High-Altitude Orthomapping with Event Cameras,"Cladera, Fernando;Chaney, Kenneth;Hsieh, M. Ani;Taylor, Camillo Jose;Kumar, Vijay","Keywords: Mapping, Field Robots, Aerial Systems: Applications","Abstract: Traditionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on CMOS-based cameras to collect images about the world below. One of the most successful applications of UAVs is to generate orthomosaics or orthomaps, in which a series of images are integrated to develop a larger map. However, using CMOS-based cameras with global or rolling shutters means that orthomaps are vulnerable to challenging light conditions, motion blur, and high-speed motion of independently moving objects (IMOs) under the camera. Event cameras are less sensitive to these issues, as their pixels trigger asynchronously on brightness changes. This work introduces the first orthomosaic approach using event cameras. We focus on addressing high-dynamic range and low-light problems in orthomosaics. In contrast to existing methods relying only on CMOS cameras, our approach enables map generation even in challenging light conditions, including direct sunlight and after sunset.",,,,,,

Aerial Robots 1,Robotics Meets Fluid Dynamics: A Characterization of the Induced Airflow below a Quadrotor As a Turbulent Jet,"Bauersfeld, Leonard;Muller, Koen;Ziegler, Dominic;Coletti, Filippo;Scaramuzza, Davide","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Calibration and Identification, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: The widespread adoption of quadrotors for diverse applications, from agriculture to public safety, necessitates an understanding of the aerodynamic disturbances they create. This paper introduces a computationally lightweight model for estimating the time-averaged magnitude of the induced flow below quadrotors in hover. Unlike related
approaches that rely on expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or drone specific time-consuming empirical measurements, our method leverages classical theory from turbulent flows. By analyzing over 16 hours of flight data from drones of varying sizes within a large motion capture system, we show for the first time that the combined flow from all drone propellers is well-approximated by a turbulent jet after 2.5 drone-diameters below the vehicle. Using a novel normalization and scaling, we experimentally identify model parameters that describe a unified mean velocity field below differently sized quadrotors. The model, which requires only the drone's mass, propeller size, and drone size for calculations, accurately describes the far-field airflow over a long-range in a very large volume which is impractible to simulate using CFD. Our model offers a practical tool for ensuring safer operations near humans, optimizing sensor placements and drone control in multi-agent scenarios. We demonstrate the latter by designing a controller that compensates for the downwash of another drone, leading to a four times lower altitude deviation when passing below.",,,,,,
Perception for Mobile Robots 1,CoDynTrust: Robust Asynchronous Collaborative Perception Via Dynamic Feature Trust Modulus,"Xu, Yunjiang;Li, Lingzhi;Wang, Jin;Yang, Benyuan;Wu, ZhiWen;Chen, Xinhong;Wang, Jianping","Keywords: Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Multi-Robot Systems, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: Collaborative perception, fusing information from multiple agents, can extend perception range so as to improve perception performance. However, temporal asynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock misalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information mismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is patchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception framework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal asynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each region of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as selectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby mitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module to handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing works that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust combats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios and allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning and control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly reduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal asynchrony.

Perception for Mobile Robots 1,The Devil Is in the Quality: Exploring Informative Samples for Semi-Supervised Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Zhang, Zhipeng;Li, Zhenyu;Wang, Hanshi;Yuan, He;Wang, Ke;Fan, Heng","Keywords: Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Recognition","Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of semi-supervised monocular 3D object detection with a general framework. In specific, having observed that the bottleneck of this task lies in lacking reliable and informative samples from unlabeled data for detector learning, we introduce a novel simple yet effective `Augment and Criticize' pipeline that mines abundant informative samples for robust detection. To be more specific, in the `Augment' stage, we present the Augmentation-based Prediction aGgregation (APG), which applies automatically learned transformations to unlabeled images and aggregates detections from various augmented views as pseudo labels. Since not all the pseudo labels from APG are beneficially informative, the subsequent `Criticize' phase is introduced. Particularly, we present the Critical Retraining Strategy (CRS) that, unlike simply filtering pseudo labels using a fixed threshold, employs a learnable network to evaluate the contribution of unlabeled images at different training timestamps. This way, the noisy samples prohibitive to model evolution can be effectively suppressed. In order to validate `Augment-Criticize', we apply it to MonoDLE and MonoFlex, and the two new detectors, dubbed 3DSeMo_DLE and 3DSeMo_FLEX, achieve state-of-the-art results with consistent improvements, evidencing its effectiveness and generality.",,,,,,

However, for long duration missions, existing works that either take directly the full pointclouds or extracted features face key tradeoffs in accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., memory consumption). To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4% decrease in localization error and 57.5% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.",,,,,,

Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present ourmethod{}, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and in-the-wild driving data demonstrate that ourmethod{} can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.",,,,,,

This work introduces the idea of spatial DCM, which adds an angular objective to the existing linear DCM theory. To incorporate the angular component into the framework, a discussion is provided on extending beyond the linear motion of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model (LIPM) towards the Single Rigid Body model (SRBM) for DCM. This work presents the angular DCM theory for a 1D rotation, simplifying the SRBM rotational dynamics to a flywheel to satisfy necessary linearity constraints. The 1D angular DCM is mathematically identical to the linear DCM and defined as an angle which is ahead of the current body rotation based on the angular velocity. This theory is combined into a 3D linear and 1D angular DCM framework, with discussion on the feasibility of simultaneously achieving both sets of objectives.

The proposed approach incorporates capturability and introduces a new constraint that forces the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) into a finite-step capture region, adjusted between consecutive MPC calls. This constraint enables the MPC to anticipate beyond its prediction horizon, preventing collisions with the walking surface boundaries. We validate the approach through high-fidelity simulations with the bipedal robot Digit, demonstrating recursively feasible MPC footstep planning in restricted regions. Future efforts will extend the approach to general polytopic constraints, thereby facilitating footstep planning in cluttered environments while preserving the MPC's recursive feasibility.",,,,,,
Legged Locomotion: Novel Methods,Realtime Limb Trajectory Optimization for Humanoid Running through Centroidal Angular Momentum Dynamics,"Sovukluk, Sait;Schuller, Robert;Englsberger, Johannes;Ott, Christian","Keywords: Humanoid and Bipedal Locomotion, Whole-Body Motion Planning and Control, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: One of the essential aspects of humanoid robot running is determining the limb-swinging trajectories. During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.",,,,,,

This study focuses on mimicking the efficient pitching motion of humans by incorporating two main approaches into a humanoid robot: (1) the use of elastic elements to assist joint torque, and (2) the optimization of motor torque to minimize energy consumption. This robot is intended to emulate human physical characteristics, such as mass, link length, and center of gravity, with a particular focus on utilizing the elastic energy generated during shoulder internal and external rotation. A leaf spring is attached in parallel with the motor at the shoulder pitch joint to release the elastic energy stored during shoulder external rotation, thereby assisting internal rotation in a manner similar to human biomechanics. Additionally, motor torque optimization is performed using Fujitsu's Digital Annealer to generate energy-efficient motions. Experiments conducted through simulations and with an actual pitching robot assessed the effectiveness of these technologies in mimicking human-like pitching motion. The results suggest that combining elastic elements with motion optimization techniques enable robots to achieve more efficient human-like movements.",,,,,,
Legged Locomotion: Novel Methods,"Single-Stage Optimization of Open-Loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives","Saud Ul Hassan, Muhammad;Hubicki, Christian","Keywords: Legged Robots, Optimization and Optimal Control, Passive Walking","Abstract: Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients.
Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties.
As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.",,,,,,

While the traditional SLIP model is valued for its simplicity and intuitive representation of running dynamics, its limitations impede its extension and integration with feedback control systems. To address this, we introduce a novel Quasi-Linearized SLIP model (QLSLIP) that incorporates additional forces in the radial and angular directions to enable stable running across various velocities. This model simplifies the analytical representation of the stance phase and defines the required swept angle

Using this model, we develop a feedback control system that ensures the stability of QLSLIP-based periodic locomotion, even in the presence of external disturbances. This control framework optimizes trajectories and sustains periodic motion in real-time across diverse scenarios.

We derive a hop-to-hop energy return map, and we use experiments and simulations to validate this map for a real robot hopping on a real deformable substrate. By analyzing the mapÂ’s fixed points and eigenvalues, we identify constant-fixed-point surfaces in parameter space that suggest it is possible to tune control parameters for efficiency or responsiveness while targeting a desired gait energy level. We also identify conditions for which the mapÂ’s fixed points are globally stable, and we characterize the basins of attraction of fixed points when these conditions are not satisfied.

Medical Robotics 1,An Adversarial Learning Framework for Reliable Myoelectric Force Estimation under Fatigue,"Pan, Huiming;Li, Dongxuan;Chen, Chen;Jiang, Shuo;Shull, Peter B.","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Deep Learning Methods, Force and Tactile Sensing","Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used as control inputs for myoelectric exoskeletons. However, muscle fatigue, which can result from prolonged use or heavy loads, significantly affects muscle activation patterns, leading to reduced estimation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an adversarial learning framework to enhance grip force estimation under fatigue conditions. The framework consists of three key components: a domain-invariant feature extractor to mitigate domain shifts between non-fatigue and fatigue states, a force estimator to predict grip forces from these domain-invariant features, and a domain discriminator to distinguish between the two domains. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset collected from eight participants performing gripping tasks under both non-fatigue and fatigue conditions, during which high-density EMG signals and grip forces were recorded simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrated that our method significantly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.264 to 0.127, outperforming a baseline model consisting of only the feature extractor and force estimator (p < 0.01). Additionally, the proposed approach exhibited consistent performance across all participants, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. These findings suggest that the proposed adversarial learning framework effectively enhances grip force estimation accuracy under muscle fatigue, offering a promising solution for improving the reliability and usability of myoelectric exoskeletons.",,,,,,

Medical Robotics 1,Exploring the Limitations and Implications of the JIGSAWS Dataset for Robot-Assisted Surgery,"Hendricks, Antonio;Panoff, Maximillian;Xiao, Kaiwen;Wang, Zhaoqi;Wang, Shuo;Bobda, Christophe","Keywords: Surgical Robotics: Laparoscopy, Medical Robots and Systems, Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking","Abstract: The JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) dataset has proven to be a foundational component of modern work on the skill analysis of robotic surgeons. In particular, methods using either the system's kinematics or video data have shown to be able to classify operators into distinct experience levels, and recent approaches have even ventured to recover numeric skill ratings assigned to assessment sessions. Although prior works have achieved positive results in these directions, challenges still remain with classification across all three levels of operator training amounts and objective skill rating regressions. To this end, we perform the first statistical analysis of the dataset itself and compile the results here. We find limited relationships between the amount of experience or training of an operator and their performance in JIGSAWS. Moreover, as operator-side kinematics have well-known relationships with their skill, previous works have used both robot and operator-side kinematics to classify operator skill; we find the first explicit relationships between pure robot-side kinematics and surgical performance. Finally, we analyze the robotic kinematic trends associated with high performance in JIGSAWS tasks and present how they may be used as indicators in human and automated surgeon training.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 1,Path Planning Using Instruction-Guided Probabilistic Roadmaps,"Bao, Jiaqi;Yonetani, Ryo","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Motion and Path Planning, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: This work presents a novel data-driven path planning algorithm named Instruction-Guided Probabilistic Roadmap (IG-PRM). Despite the recent development and widespread use of mobile robot navigation, the safe and effective travels of mobile robots still require significant engineering effort to take into account the constraints of robots and their tasks. With IG-PRM, we aim to address this problem by allowing robot operators to specify such constraints through natural language instructions, such as ``aim for wider paths'' or ``mind small gaps''. The key idea is to convert such instructions into embedding vectors using large-language models (LLMs) and use the vectors as a condition to predict instruction-guided cost maps from occupancy maps. By constructing a roadmap based on the predicted costs, we can find instruction-guided paths via the standard shortest path search. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world indoor navigation environments.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 1,Pushing through Clutter with Movability Awareness of Blocking Obstacles,"Weeda, Joris J.;Bakker, Saray;Chen, Gang;Alonso-Mora, Javier","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Collision Avoidance, Integrated Planning and Control","Abstract: Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) poses a challenge for traditional path-planning methods when obstacles block the path, requiring push actions to reach the goal. We propose a framework that enables movability-aware planning to overcome this challenge without relying on explicit obstacle placement. Our framework integrates a global Semantic Visibility Graph and a local Model Predictive Path Integral (SVG-MPPI) approach to efficiently sample rollouts, taking into account the continuous range of obstacle movability. A physics engine is adopted to simulate the interaction result of the rollouts with the environment, and generate trajectories with lower contact force. Qualitative and quantitative experiments suggest that SVG-MPPI outperforms existing paradigm that uses only binary movability for planning, achieving higher success rates with reduced cumulative contact forces. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tud-amr/SVG-MPPI",,,,,,
Motion Planning 1,Improving Efficiency in Path Planning: Tangent Line Decomposition Algorithm,"Tian, Yu;Ren, Hongliang","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: This paper introduces a tangent line decomposition (TLD) algorithm that efficiently finds collision-free paths close to optimal in both 2D and 3D environment. Compared with the existing visibility line-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm innovatively proposed the concept of tangent line decomposition, which decomposes complicated planning into many simple steps. For each step, only one key obstacle is taken into consideration. Besides, instead of constructing a complete graph, a best-first search algorithm is used to avoid searching redundant edges. The path planned by the algorithm is not the optimal path. However, following the idea of the informed RRT* algorithm, the path length planned by TLD can be used as a precondition for other optimal algorithms. In this way, the overall efficiency can be significantly improved. The simulations show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods regarding planning efficiency and solution quality.",,,,,,

Motion Planning 1,Search-Based Path Planning in Interactive Environments among Movable Obstacles,"Ren, Zhongqiang;Suvonov, Bunyod;Chen, Guofei;He, Botao;Liao, Yijie;Fermuller, Cornelia;Zhang, Ji",Keywords: Motion and Path Planning,"Abstract: This paper investigates Path planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO), which seeks a minimum cost collision-free path among static obstacles from start to goal while allowing the robot to push away movable obstacles (i.e., objects) along its path when needed. To develop planners that are complete and optimal for PAMO, the planner has to search a giant state space involving both the location of the robot as well as the locations of the objects, which grows exponentially with respect to the number of objects. This paper leverages a simple yet under-explored idea that, only a small fraction of this giant state space needs to be searched during planning as guided by a heuristic, and most of the objects far away from the robot are intact, which thus leads to runtime efficient algorithms. Based on this idea, this paper introduces two PAMO formulations, i.e., bi-objective and resource constrained problems in an occupancy grid, and develops PAMO*, a planning method with completeness and solution optimality guarantees, to solve the two problems. We then further extend PAMO* to hybrid-state PAMO* to plan in continuous spaces with high-fidelity interaction between the robot and the objects. Our results show that, PAMO* can often find optimal solutions within a second in cluttered maps with up to 400 objects.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 1,Neural Encodings for Energy-Efficient Motion Planning,"Shah, Deval;Zhao, Jocelyn;Aamodt, Tor Michael","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Energy and Environment-Aware Automation, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Neural motion planners can increase motion plan- ning quality and, by reducing collision detection computations, improve runtime. However, when profiled on an accelerator-rich hardware system, neural planning contributes to more than 50% of the runtime, and 33% of the computation energy consumption, motivating the design of compute- and energy-efficient neural planners. In this work, we propose a neural planner using Binary Encoded Labels (BEL), where a set of binary classifiers are used instead of a typical regression network. Compared to conventional regression-based neural planners, the proposed BEL neural planner reduces neural planning (inference) computation and collision detection checks while maintaining equal or higher motion planning success rate across various motion planning benchmarks. This computation reduction can improve the energy efficiency of neural planning by 1.4xâˆ?1.4x. Finally, we demonstrate the trade-offs between collision detection and neural planning computation to maximize energy efficiency for different hardware configurations.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 1,Rigid Body Path Planning Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,"Yu, Mingxin;Fan, Chuchu","Keywords: Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: Navigating rigid body objects through crowded environments can be challenging, especially when narrow passages are presented. Existing sampling-based planners and optimization-based methods like mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, suffer from limited scalability with respect to either the size of the workspace or the number of obstacles. In order to address the scalability issue, we propose a three-stage algorithm that first generates a graph of convex polytopes in the workspace free of collision, then poses a large set of small MILPs to generate viable paths between polytopes, and finally queries a pair of start and end configurations for a feasible path online. The graph of convex polytopes serves as a decomposition of the free workspace and the number of decision variables in each MILP is limited by restricting the subproblem within two or three free polytopes rather than the entire free region. Our simulation results demonstrate shorter online computation time compared to baseline methods and scales better with the size of the environment and tunnel width than sampling-based planners in both 2D and 3D environments.",,,,,,

We present algorithms which allow a human to sculpt a swarm of robots into a shape that persists in space perpetually, independent of onboard energy constraints such as batteries. Robots generate a path through a shape such that robots cycle in and out of the shape. Robots inside the shape react to human initiated changes and adapt the path through the shape accordingly. Robots outside the shape recharge and return to the shape so that the shape can persist indefinitely. The presented algorithms communicate shape changes throughout the swarm using message passing and robot motion. These algorithms enable the swarm to persist through any arbitrary changes to the shape. We describe these algorithms in detail and present their performance in simulation and on a swarm of mobile robots. The result is a swarm behavior more suitable for extended duration, dynamic shape-based tasks in applications such as entertainment, agriculture, and emergency response.",,,,,,
Calibration 1,Kinematic Calibration of a Redundant Robot in Closed-Loop System Using Indicated Competitive Swarm Method,"Kim, Jaehyung;Lee, Min Cheol","Keywords: Calibration and Identification, Redundant Robots, Kinematics","Abstract: Previous calibration techniques often relied on specialized end-effector tracking devices, such as a laser tracker, which can be expensive and impractical in specific environments. Furthermore, research on the calibration of redundant manipulators has been relatively scarce compared to non-redundant counterparts. To overcome these limitations, this article introduces a novel method for kinematic calibration of a damaged redundant serial robot, employing an indicated competitive swarm optimization with a finite-screw deviation model. The proposed kinematic calibration method utilizes a kinematic closed-loop method, which identifies an axis deviation without using expensive end-effector tracking equipment. Moreover, a competitive-swarm-inspired optimization model is introduced to efficiently identify axis deviations, significantly reducing the required calibration points compared to prior studies and thereby facilitating calibration for redundant manipulators. Both simulation and experiment were conducted to validate the proposed method using a seven-degree-of-freedom redundant serial robot.

Traditional calibration methods rely on manual effort or specific targets, limiting adaptability to complex environments. Learning-based calibration methods still face challenges, such as insufficient overlap between the fields of view (FoV) of multiple sensors and suboptimal cross-modal feature association, which hinder accurate parameter regression. Unlike traditional CNN-based networks, we propose a KansFormer-based self-Calibration Network for camera and LiDAR (KFCalibNet) that replaces fixed activation functions and linear transformations with learnable nonlinear activation functions. This enables the extraction of more fine-grained features from both image and point cloud, significantly enhancing the network's robustness in scenarios with limited FoV overlap. We also employ a multihead attention (MHA) module to compute correlations between image and point cloud features, significantly enhancing cross-modal feature association. To reduce learning complexity, we designed KansFormer with FastKAN as the feedforward network, enabling deep fusion and regression of fine-grained cross-modal features for accurate extrinsic calibration. KFCalibNet achieves an absolute average calibration error of 0.0965 cm in translation and 0.0234Â° in rotation on the KITTI Odometry dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art calibration methods.

In environments where vision systems are not reliable, proprioceptive state estimators become indispensable. Traditionally, proprioceptive state estimators are based on model-based approaches, which rely solely on contact foot kinematics as measurements. In contrast, learning-based approaches have obtained new measurements, such as displacement and covariance, by leveraging real-world data in a supervised manner. In this work, we develop a state estimation framework that trains a neural measurement network (NMN) to estimate the base's linear velocity and foot contact probability, which are then employed as measurements in an invariant extended Kalman filter. Our approach relies solely on simulation data for training, as it allows us to obtain extensive data easily.

Classically, robots' inertial parameters are obtained from CAD models that are not precise (and sometimes not available, e.g., Spot from Boston Dynamics), hence requiring identification. To do that, existing methods require access to contact force measurement, a modality not present in modern quadruped and humanoid robots. This paper presents an alternative technique that utilizes joint current/torque measurements Â—a standard sensing modality in modern robotsÂ— to identify inertial parameters without requiring direct contact force measurements. By projecting the whole-body dynamics into the null space of contact constraints, we eliminate the dependency on contact forces and reformulate the identification problem as a linear matrix inequality that can handle physical and geometrical constraints. We compare our proposed method against a common black-box identification method using a deep neural network and show that incorporating physical consistency significantly improves the sample efficiency and generalizability of the model.

This allows us to apply the virtual work method to evaluate contact forces across the entire surface of the leg-wheel, including the tips, sides, and other contact regions. This adaptability is particularly advantageous in hybrid locomotion modes, where different parts of the leg-wheel interact with the terrain.

Identifcation and Estimation for Legged Robots,Fast Decentralized State Estimation for Legged Robot Locomotion Via EKF and MHE,"Xiong, Xiaobin;Kang, Jiarong;Wang, Yi","Keywords: Legged Robots, Sensor Fusion","Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast and decentralized state estimation framework for the control of legged locomotion. The nonlinear estimation of the floating base states is decentralized to an orientation estimation via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a linear velocity estimation via Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). The EKF fuses the inertia sensor with vision to estimate the floating base orientation. The MHE uses the estimated orientation with all the sensors within a time window in the past to estimate the linear velocities based on a time-varying linear dynamics formulation of the interested states with state constraints. More importantly, a marginalization method based on the optimization structure of the full information filter (FIF) is proposed to convert the equality-constrained FIF to an equivalent MHE.

To address this, we introduce an eldercare robot (E-BAR) capable of lifting a human body, assisting with postural changes/ambulation, and catching a user during a fall, all without the use of any wearable device or harness. Our robot is the first to integrate these 3 tasks, and is capable of lifting the full weight of a human outside of the robotÂ’s base of support (across gaps and obstacles). In developing E-BAR, we interviewed nurses and care professionals and conducted user-experience tests with elderly persons. Based on their functional requirements, the design parameters were optimized using a computational model and trade-off analysis. We developed a novel 18-bar linkage to lift a person from a floor to a standing position along a natural trajectory, while providing maximal mechanical advantage at key points. An omnidirectional, non-holonomic drive base, in which the wheels could be oriented to passively maximize floor grip, enabled the robot to resist lateral forces without active compensation. With a minimum width of 38 cm, the robotÂ’s small footprint allowed it to navigate the typical home environment. Four airbags were used to catch and stabilize a user during a fall in less than 250 ms. We demonstrate E-BAR's utility in multiple typical home scenarios, including getting into/out of a bathtub, bending to reach for objects, sit-to-stand transitions, and ambulation.",,,,,,

Misalignment or improper handling of these devices can reduce their effectiveness, increasing the risk of collisions and injuries. This paper presents an AI-based embedded system designed to predict and correct the orientation of a guide cane in real time. By integrating an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with a neural network, the system continuously monitors the cane's lateral angle and orientation while providing feedback to help the user self-correct.

The extra DoFs lead to larger design space in structure and control policies, which is complex and timeconsuming with the traditional manual design process. In this pilot study, we proposed a novel morphology-controller cooptimization framework to automatically generate and optimize the SRL structure based on the locomotion task input. There are two layers, with the inner layer optimizing the controller to achieve human-robot synchronization, and the outer layer optimizing the morphology parameters for performance enhancement. We validated the proposed framework through simulations using SRLs in a load-bearing locomotion task. The results demonstrate that the controller optimization can automatically generate realistic gait patterns and stable humanrobot synchronization, while the SRLs significantly improve the userÂ’s load-bearing capability. Additionally, the co-optimization process reduces both the manufacturing cost of the SRL and the torque on the joints. This approach shows potential for exhaustive exploration of the design space and acceleration of the design process. Future works will be done in a more realistic SRL generative design model and achieve Sim2Real for practical uses.",,,,,,

Assistive Robotics 1,"IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition","Liu, Rui;Mahammad, Zahiruddin;Bhaskar, Amisha;Tokekar, Pratap","Keywords: Human-Centered Robotics, Representation Learning, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robotÂ’s capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approachÂ’s robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves an improvement up to 35% in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.",,,,,,
Assistive Robotics 1,An Interactive Hands-Free Controller for a Riding Ballbot to Enable Simple Shared Control Tasks,"Xiao, Chenzhang;Song, Seung Yun;Chen, Yu;Mansouri, Mahshid;Ramos, Joao;Norris, William;Hsiao-Wecksler, Elizabeth T.","Keywords: Physically Assistive Devices, Physical Human-Robot Interaction, Human-Centered Robotics","Abstract: Our team developed a riding ballbot (called PURE) that is dynamically stable, omnidirectional, and driven by lean-to-steer control. A hands-free admittance control scheme (HACS) was previously integrated to allow riders with different torso functions to control the robot's movements via torso leaning and twisting. Such an interface requires motor coordination skills and could result in collisions with obstacles due to low proficiency. Hence, a shared controller (SC) that limits the speed of PURE could be helpful to ensure the safety of riders. However, the self-balancing dynamics of PURE could result in a weak control authority of its motion, in which the torso motion of the rider could easily result in poor tracking of the command speed dictated by the shared controller. Thus, we proposed an interactive hands-free admittance control scheme (iHACS), which added two modules to the HACS to improve the speed-tracking performance of PURE: control gain personalization module and interaction compensation module. Human riding tests of simple tasks, idle-keeping and speed-limiting, were conducted to compare the performance of HACS and iHACS. Two manual wheelchair users and two able-bodied individuals participated in this study. They were instructed to use ``adversarial"" torso motions that would tax the SC's ability to keep the ballbot idling or below a set speed, i.e., competing objectives between rider and robot. In the idle-keeping tasks, iHACS demonstrated minimal translational motion and low command speed tracking RMSE, even with significant torso lean angles. During the speed-limiting task, where the commanded speed was saturated at 0.5 m/s, the system achieved an average maximum speed of 1.1 m/s with iHACS, compared with that of over 1.9 m/s with HACS. These results suggest that iHACS can enhance PURE's control authority over the rider, which enables PURE to provide physical interactions back to the rider and results in a collaborative rider-robot synergy.",,,,,,
Assistive Robotics 1,Garment Diffusion Models for Robot-Assisted Dressing,"Kotsovolis, Stelios;Demiris, Yiannis","Keywords: Physical Human-Robot Interaction, Model Learning for Control, Human-Centered Robotics","Abstract: Robots have the potential to assist people with disabilities and the elderly. One of the most common and burdensome tasks for caregivers is dressing. Two challenges of robot-assisted dressing are modeling the dynamics of garments and handling visual occlusions that obstruct the perception of the full state of the garment due to the proximity between the garment, the robot, and the human. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based dynamics model for garments during robot-assisted dressing that can deal with partial point cloud observations. The diffusion model, conditioned on the observation and the robot's action, is used to predict a full point cloud of the garment's opening of the future state. The model is utilized in a model predictive controller, that is trained iteratively with model-based reinforcement learning. In our experiments, we examine a common problem of dressing: the insertion of a garment's sleeve on an arm. As demonstrated by the performed experiments, the proposed diffusion-based model predictive controller can be effectively used for robot-assisted dressing and handle visual occlusions. Moreover, our approach is highly sample-efficient. Specifically, the controller achieved 91.2% success rate in the examined dressing task with less than 100 sampled trajectories. Real-wold experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to the sim-to-real gap and generalize well to novel garments and configurations of the body.",,,,,,

Tracking and Prediction 1,Visual-Linguistic Reasoning for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction,"Shenkut, Dereje;Vijaya Kumar, B.V.K",Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Abstract: Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent on roads. The dynamic nature of urban environments and the less predictable behavior of pedestrians present significant challenges in developing reliable prediction models. Earlier methods relying on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promise, but often fail to fully take advantage of the rich visual and contextual information available in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer new opportunities to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by incorporating multimodal reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses a powerful pre-trained VLM to improve the estimation of pedestrian trajectories. Specifically, we first enable learning of semantically useful scene context and high-level reasoning feature via vision-language model fine-tuning on specific prompts using road scenes with pedestrians. Next, with the learned VLM features and the pedestrian's past trajectory history, we predict future trajectories using an encoder-decoder head.

In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning.

Manipulation 1,MeshDMP: Motion Planning on Discrete Manifolds Using Dynamic Movement Primitives,"Dalle Vedove, Matteo;Abu-Dakka, Fares;Palopoli, Luigi;Fontanelli, Daniele;Saveriano, Matteo","Keywords: Learning from Demonstration, Constrained Motion Planning","Abstract: An open problem in industrial automation is to reliably perform tasks requiring in-contact movements with complex workpieces, as current solutions lack the ability to seamlessly adapt to the workpiece geometry. In this paper, we propose a Learning from Demonstration approach that allows a robot manipulator to learn and generalise motions across complex surfaces by leveraging differential mathematical operators on discrete manifolds to embed information on the geometry of the workpiece extracted from triangular meshes, and extend the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) framework to generate motions on the mesh surfaces. We also propose an effective strategy to adapt the motion to different surfaces, by introducing an isometric transformation of the learned forcing term. The resulting approach, namely MeshDMP, is evaluated both in simulation and real experiments, showing promising results in typical industrial automation tasks like car surface polishing.",,,,,,
Manipulation 1,Robotic Sim-To-Real Transfer for Long-Horizon Pick-And-Place Tasks in the Robotic Sim2Real Competition,"Yang, Ming;Cao, Hongyu;Zhao, Lixuan;Zhang, Chenrui;Chen, Yaran","Keywords: Engineering for Robotic Systems, Mobile Manipulation, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: This paper presents a fully autonomous robotic system that performs sim-to-real transfer in complex long-horizon tasks involving navigation, recognition, grasping, and stacking in an environment with multiple obstacles. The key feature of the system is the ability to overcome typical sensing and actuation discrepancies during sim-to-real transfer and to achieve consistent performance without any algorithmic modifications. To accomplish this, a lightweight noise-resistant visual perception system and a nonlinearity-robust servo system are adopted. We conduct a series of tests in both simulated and real-world environments. The visual perception system achieves the speed of 11 ms per frame due to its lightweight nature, and the servo system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with the proposed controller. Both exhibit high consistency during sim-to-real transfer. Our robotic system took first place in the mineral searching task of the Robotic Sim2Real Challenge hosted at ICRA 2024.

Manipulation 1,Towards Autonomous Data Annotation and System-Agnostic Robotic Grasping Benchmarking with 3D-Printed Fixtures,"Boerdijk, Wout;Durner, Maximilian;Sakagami, Ryo;Lehner, Peter;Triebel, Rudolph","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Grasping, Data Sets for Robotic Vision","Abstract: The interaction of robots with their environment requires robust object-centric perception capabilities, typically achieved using learning-based methods trained on synthetic data. However, real-world deployment demands evaluating these capabilities in relevant environments, often involving extensive manual annotation for a quantitative analysis. Additionally, standardized evaluations for robotic tasks, such as grasping, need reproducible object scene configurations and performance benchmarks. We propose a solution to both problems by temporarily employing 3D-printed components, so-called fixtures, which can be designed for any rigid object. Once the scene is set up and object poses are extracted, the fixtures are removed, leaving the natural scene without any artificial distractions. The presented approach is seemingly applicable for pre-determined configurations of multiple objects, which enables precise re-building of scenes with consistent object-to-object relations. Our suggested annotation procedure achieves strong pose accuracy solely on RGB images without any manual involvement. We evaluate and show the usability of the proposed fixtures for automated real-world data annotation to fine-tune a detector and for benchmarking object pose estimation algorithms for robotic grasping. Code and fixture meshes for 3D printing are available at https://github.com/DLR-RM/fixture_generation.",,,,,,

However, tuning these controllers remains a significant hurdle. To address this hurdle, we propose a practical MPC formulation which retains the more interpretable tuning parameters of the instantaneous control approach while enhancing performance through a prediction horizon. The formulation is motivated at hand of a simple example, highlighting the practical tuning challenges associated with typical MPC approaches and showing how the proposed formulation alleviates these challenges. Furthermore, the formulation is validated on a surface-following task, illustrating its applicability to industrially relevant scenarios. Although the research is presented in the context of robot manipulator control, we anticipate that the formulation is more broadly applicable.",,,,,,
Prosthetics and Physically Assistive Devices,A Control Framework for Accurate Mechanical Impedance Rendering with Series-Elastic Joints in Prosthetic Actuation Applications,"Harris, Isaac;Rouse, Elliott;Gregg, Robert D.;Thomas, Gray","Keywords: Compliance and Impedance Control, Compliant Joints and Mechanisms, Prosthetics and Exoskeletons","Abstract: In addition to lifting up the body during gait, human legs provide stabilizing torques that can be modeled as a spring-damper mechanical impedance. While powered prosthetic leg actuators can also imitate spring-damper be- haviors, the rendered impedance can be quite different from the desired impedance, stemming from unmodeled torques in the transmission (e.g., sliding friction, bearing damping, gear inefficiency, etc.). Moreover, for powered prostheses to mimic human joint impedance, they will need actuators that accurately render a wide range of mechanical impedances in a variety of ground contact conditions, including nearly free-swinging behavior in swing phase and stiff spring-like behavior in stance phase. For series-elastic prosthetic leg actuators, as in Open- Source Leg (OSL), these sudden output inertia changes present a challenge for traditional cascaded impedance control. In this paper we propose a solution based on disturbance observers and full state feedback (FSF) impedance control. With transmission disturbances attenuated, the FSF controller can use pole-zero placement to specify the actuator impedance that couples to the uncertain joint inertia. We validate our control framework on an OSL-like two-actuator dynamometry testbed.",,,,,,

The proposed robot differs from traditional walker-type or cane-type aids by offering adaptive, minimal touch support based on the user's walking dynamics. Our goal is to realize versatile touch to the user as a preliminary study for developing the adaptive touch walking support robot. To achieve this, we've established a categorization system for walking support touch, outlining the specific types of assistance required for our robot. Based on these categorization, we've developed a prototype that improves the versatility of touch support (touch point, force, and initiator), adapting to the user's body. Our prototype is equipped to offer multiple touch support parts, adjusting to the user's physique. For versatile touch capabilities, we designed a motion control algorithm that includes a controller which directs the robot's wheel movements according to the chosen support points, and a state machine that provides multiple arm placements and movements. We have experimentally implemented this motion control algorithm in our prototype. Through experiments, we verified the touch versatility and discussed the prototype's utility and potential for further development.",,,,,,

However, elderly individuals often find these motions difficult to perform with declining lower limb strength, which causes a considerable reduction to their quality of life. In this study, a sensing method for controlling robotic assistive devices was proposed. This method utilizes electromyographic measurements and a deep neural network to predict motion initiation, and it estimates the timing of triggering assistive devices. Experimental results indicate that four muscle synergy patterns are required to represent the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions together, with two of them being shared between both movements.

Prosthetics and Physically Assistive Devices,"On Chain Driven, Adaptive, Underactuated Fingers for the Development of Affordable, Robust Humanlike Prosthetic Hands","Heinemann, Trevor;Wallace, Raymond;Liarokapis, Minas","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Medical Robots and Systems","Abstract: Amputations and limb loss can have detrimental effects on personal well-being. Although prosthetic devices can offer significant benefits helping amputees regain some of the lost dexterity, they often lack the required affordability and durability. Current affordable prosthetic designs have trended towards underactuation which leads to stable grasps but is often characterized by low durability. In this paper, a new chain driven, adaptive, underactuated finger design has been proposed for the development of affordable and highly durable prosthetic hands. The transmission mechanism employed is in the form of a steel roller chain. The finger phalanges are constructed of 3D printed PLA, and finger flexion is produced by pulling the internally routed roller chain that is rerouted using sprockets. In total, six 3D printed PLA sprockets are used for chain routing, with an emphasis on high force transmission. The performance of the proposed chain-driven finger was experimentally validated and compared with an analogous tendon-driven version. The metrics employed for this comparison were longevity, pinch grasp efficiency, force response, and maximum force capability. The chain driven finger was shown to have a higher maximum transmissible force, better long term durability, and no issues related to elongation (such as tendon elongation). The cost to manufacture the chain driven robotic finger is only 91 USD, making it an excellent solution for affordable prostheses.",,,,,,
Prosthetics and Physically Assistive Devices,Force Myography Based Torque Estimation in Human Knee and Ankle Joints,"Marquardt, Charlotte;Schulz, Arne;Dezman, Miha;Kurz, Gunther;Stein, Thorsten;Asfour, Tamim","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Physically Assistive Devices, Wearable Robotics","Abstract: The online adaptation of exoskeleton control based on muscle activity sensing offers a promising approach to personalizing exoskeleton behavior based on the userÂ’s biosignals. While electromyography (EMG)-based methods have demonstrated improvements in joint torque estimation, EMG sensors require direct skin contact and extensive post-processing. In contrast, force myography (FMG) measures normal forces resulting from changes in muscle volume due to muscle activity. We propose an FMG-based method to estimate knee and ankle joint torques by integrating joint angles and velocities with muscle activity data. We learn a model for joint torque estimation using Gaussian process regression (GPR). The effectiveness of the proposed FMG-based method is validated on isokinetic motions performed by ten participants. The model is compared to a baseline model that uses only joint angle and velocity, as well as a model augmented by EMG data. The results indicate that incorporating FMG into exoskeleton control can improve the estimation of joint torque for the ankle and knee joints in novel task characteristics within a single participant. Although the findings suggest that this approach may not improve the generalizability of estimates between multiple participants, they highlight the need for further research into its potential applications in exoskeleton control.",,,,,,

Intelligent Transportation and Smart Cities,The Automation of Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Traffic Management Calibration Based on Experimental Platform Data,"Henderson, Thomas C.;Sacharny, David;Mello, Chad;Raley, William","Keywords: Automation Technologies for Smart Cities, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: Many countries are developing an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) capability defining an Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) architecture to allow safe UAS services in urban environments (e.g., delivery, inspection, air taxis, etc.). The main considerations are air worthiness, operator certification, air traffic management, C2 Link, detect and avoid (DAA), safety management, and security. In addition, if thousands of simultaneous UAS flights are to be achieved, it is not possible for them to be controlled individually by human operators. This makes it necessary to have a rigorous and safe automation methodology to handle such a number of flights. A lane-based airspace structure has been proposed which reduces the complexity of strategic deconfliction by providing UAS agents with a set of pre-defined airway corridors called lanes. This yields collateral benefits including UAS information privacy, robust contingency handling exploiting the lane structure, as well as improved observability and control of the air space. A robust set of UTM parameters and policies must be determined based on the performance characteristics of the deployed UAS platforms, and a methodology which constitutes a first step toward this end is proposed and demonstrated here. In order to realize this approach, a set of initial experiments have been performed to determine the constraints imposed by the UTM on UAS platform capabilities and vice versa. Initial implementation parameters and policies are defined. The major contribution here is a methodology to calibrate UTM safety parameters (e.g., headway, platform speed) in terms of specific platform modelsÂ’ operational characteristics. That is, UTM parameters are a function of platform and not some arbitrarily imposed values. Safety uncertainty is then characterized by the calibration method.",,,,,,

By classifying the users into dynamic energy consumption classes to reward energy efficiency and penalize excessive use, users can modify their behavior to pass to a less expensive and more virtuous consumption class. To this aim, a blockchain platform determines the rewards and penalties and, by a K-means clustering algorithm, categorizes users into respective groups. Then, a Class Follower Problem is formulated and solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory network as a predictive model. If the users follow the suggestions proposed by the controller, i.e., the thermostat set-points and the time intervals in which the HVAC system must be switched off or on, the users can be located in a more virtuous consumption class.

Intelligent Transportation and Smart Cities,Non-Parametric GNSS Integer Ambiguity Estimation Via Positional Likelihood Field Marginalization,"Takanose, Aoki;Koide, Kenji;Oishi, Shuji;Yokozuka, Masashi","Keywords: Localization, Autonomous Agents, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: In this paper, we propose a non-parametric method for estimating the posterior distribution of GNSS integer ambiguity. Is is difficult to estimate the posterior probability of discrete integer ambiguities directly from carrier phase observations due to the unclear domain definition. We thus introduce the positional likelihood field that accumulates the ambiguity function method values in the positional space and then estimate the integer ambiguity distributions by marginalizing the likelihood over the entire position. Because the positional likelihood field is defined in the positional space, it enables ease of carrier phase likelihood accumulation. In order to correctly estimate the posterior distribution, however, a sufficient density of the samples is required that results in a large computational cost. The proposed method enables large-scale sampling by taking advantage of GPU parallel processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and robust estimation of integer ambiguity distributions, contributing to improved centimeter-level position estimation accuracy. In addition, the histograms provided quantitative evidence of events in urban environments where integer ambiguity is not uniquely determined.",,,,,,
Intelligent Transportation and Smart Cities,"Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics","Kreutz, Thomas;MÃ¼hlhÃ¤user, Max;Sanchez Guinea, Alejandro","Keywords: Automation Technologies for Smart Cities, Modeling and Simulating Humans, Simulation and Animation","Abstract: Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.",,,,,,

However, unlike other legged robots, exoskeletons face specific constraints on where depth sensors can be mounted due to the presence of a human user. These constraints lead to a limited Field Of View (FOV) and greater sensor motion, making odometry particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a novel odometry algorithm that integrates proprioceptive data from the exoskeleton with point clouds from a depth camera to produce accurate elevation maps despite these limitations. Our method builds on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse kinematic and inertial measurements, while incorporating a tailored iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register new point clouds with the elevation map. Experimental validation with a leg exoskeleton demonstrates that our approach reduces drift and enhances the quality of elevation maps compared to a purely proprioceptive baseline, while also outperforming a more traditional point cloud map-based variant.",,,,,,
Visual-Inertial Odometry,Improving Monocular Visual-Inertial Initialization with Structureless Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment,"Song, Junlin;Richard, Antoine;Olivares-Mendez, Miguel A.",Keywords: Localization,"Abstract: Monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) has facilitated a wide range of real-time motion tracking applications, thanks to the small size of the sensor suite and low power consumption. To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution.

Visual-Inertial Odometry,QVIO2: Quantized MAP-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry,"Peng, Yuxiang;Chen, Chuchu;Huang, Guoquan (Paul)","Keywords: Visual-Inertial SLAM, Localization, SLAM","Abstract: Energy-efficient visual-inertial motion tracking on SWAP-constrained edge devices (e.g., drones and AR glasses) is essential but challenging. Our previous work introduced the first-of-its-kind quantized visual-inertial odometry (QVIO), utilizing either raw measurement quantization (zQVIO) or single-bit residual quantization (rQVIO). While QVIO has demonstrated significant data transfer reduction with competitive performance, but it has limitations. Specifically, zQVIO directly quantizes raw measurements into multi-bit values, while requiring the ad-hoc inflation of measurement noise to account for quantization errors. On the other hand, rQVIO is limited to single-bit measurement with a certain accuracy loss. This work introduces QVIO2 to address these issues. The proposed QVIO2 improves data quantization strategies and derives a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) quantized estimator that rigorously handles both multi-bit and single-bit, raw and residual quantized measurements in a unified manner. These improvements lead to more communication-efficient and accurate systems. Additionally, we optimize the communication protocol to further reduce data transfer by eliminating un- necessary transmissions. Extensive numerical and experimental results demonstrate reduced communication requirements and improved accuracy. Compared to the previous QVIO system, zQVIO2 achieves the same accuracy with a 30% reduction in data transfer, while rQVIO2 improves accuracy without increasing data communication. In real-world scenarios, our new zQVIO2 and rQVIO2 have demonstrated nearly no accuracy loss with only 4.6 bits and 3.5 bits of data communication, achieving compression rates of 7Ã— and 9.1Ã—.",,,,,,
Visual-Inertial Odometry,Is Iteration Worth It? Revisit Its Impact in Sliding-Window VIO,"Chen, Chuchu;Peng, Yuxiang;Huang, Guoquan (Paul)","Keywords: Visual-Inertial SLAM, Sensor Fusion, Localization","Abstract: Visual-inertial odometry (VIO), which fuses noisy inertial readings and camera measurements to provide 3D motion tracking, is a foundational component in many autonomous applications. With the increasing use of next-generation edge devices (e.g., IoT devices, nano drones, and mobile robotics) that are constrained by limited power, resources, and multi-tasking demands, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy in VIO estimators has become more critical than ever. Historically, state estimation algorithms have been developed using either optimization-based or filtering-based methods, with the key distinction being the ability to relinearize measurements and correct state estimates iteratively. While it has been widely claimed that iterative methods improve accuracy by allowing for the reduction of error through relinearization at a higher computational demand. Conversely, filtering methods are more efficient but may suffer from significant linearization errors. However, these trade-offs have not been thoroughly examined in the context of visual-inertial motion tracking. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on the impact of iterative algorithms in sliding-window VIO. We analyze the relinearization of IMU and camera measurements separately, providing insights into how each affects system performance. By considering key factors such as system observability and measurement processes, we offer a deeper understanding of VIO estimator behavior. Our findings, supported by proof-of-concept real-world tests, provide practical guidelines for balancing accuracy and efficiency, helping practitioners determine when to prioritize iterative methods or simpler filtering approaches while encouraging researchers and engineers to rethink VIO design for optimal resource allocation.",,,,,,

In addition, most approaches have considered the effect of dynamic objects only at the feature association level. In this study, we observed that the state estimation diverges when errors from false correspondences owing to moving objects incorrectly propagate into the IMU bias terms. To overcome these problems, we propose a robust VINS framework called DynaVINS++, which employs a) adaptive truncated least square method that adaptively adjusts the truncation range using both feature association and IMU preintegration to effectively minimize the effect of the dynamic objects while reducing the computational cost, and b) stable state recovery with bias consistency check to correct misestimated IMU bias and to prevent the divergence caused by abruptly dynamic objects. As verified in both public and real-world datasets, our approach shows promising performance in dynamic environments, including scenes with abruptly dynamic objects.",,,,,,
Teleoperation,A Pragmatic Approach to Bi-Directional Impedance Reflection Telemanipulation Control: Design and User Study,"Lieftink, Robin;Falcone, Sara;Van Der Walt, Christophe;Van Erp, Jan;Dresscher, Douwe","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Haptics and Haptic Interfaces, Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop","Abstract: Force feedback generally increases the effectiveness of execution and sense of embodiment on telemanipulation systems. However, systems with force feedback are vulnerable to time delays, reducing their transparency and stability. In this paper, we implement a bi-directional impedance reflection controller, a concept that was presented already in 1989 by Blake Hannaford [1] but was never fully implemented. In this method, the simplified impedances of the operator and the environment are estimated and reflected back to the remote robot and haptic interface, respectively. A trajectory predictor is added to compensate for the delayed motion. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the system in a user study, comparing it to a system with a classical bilateral impedance controller with passivity layers. Three time delay groups (0, 10, and 20 ms one-way delay) of 10 participants each executed different tasks with both controllers. The results show that the bi-directional impedance reflection controller performs significantly better in the 10 ms and 20 ms time delay groups, in terms of task performance, user experience and sense of embodiment. We conclude that this study is the first to show that bi-directional impedance reflection is robust to time delays of at least 20 ms.",,,,,,
Teleoperation,3D Whole-Body Pose Estimation Using Graph High-Resolution Network for Humanoid Robot Teleoperation,"Zhang, Mingyu;Gao, Qing;Lai, Yuanchuan;Zhang, Ye;Chang, Tao;Guo, Yulan","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Gesture, Posture and Facial Expressions, Human Detection and Tracking","Abstract: In the realm of robotics, teleoperation plays a pivotal role in performing high-risk or intricate tasks, and obtaining precise 3D whole-body pose is crucial for this purpose. Traditional two-stage methods have limitations in estimating different body parts, leading to complex systems and higher estimation errors. In order to address these issues,the paper introduces a novel framework called Graph High-Resolution Network(GraphHRNet) for accurate 3D whole-body pose estimation, which is essential for the teleoperation of humanoid robots. GraphHRNet effectively captures global structural information and local details by integrating a High-Resolution Module and a Multi-branch Regression Module. The High-Resolution Module utilizes an enhanced graph convolution kernel to fuse multi-scale features, capturing global information, while the Multi-branch Regression Module focuses on refining and predicting accurate 3D coordinates for intricate body parts such as hands and face. Experimental results on the H3WB dataset demonstrate that GraphHRNet surpasses state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods in 3D whole-body pose estimation , significantly improving performance. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential application of this approach in a teleoperation system for humanoid robots, providing an intuitive and high-fidelity solution for remotely executing complex tasks.

However, current robot learning algorithms primarily focus on trajectory-based policy, with limited attention given to learning force-related skills. To address this limitation, we introduce ForceMimic, a force-centric robot learning system, providing a natural, force-aware and robot-free robotic demonstration collection system, along with a hybrid force-motion imitation learning algorithm for robust contact-rich manipulation. Using the proposed ForceCapture system, an operator can peel a zucchini in 5 minutes, while force-feedback teleoperation takes over 13 minutes and struggles with task completion. With the collected data, we propose HybridIL to train a force-centric imitation learning model, equipped with hybrid force-position control primitive to fit the predicted wrench-position parameters during robot execution. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the model to learn a more robust policy under the contact-rich task of vegetable peeling, increasing the success rates by 54.5% relatively compared to state-of-the-art pure-vision-based imitation learning.

Teleoperation,How to Train Your Robots? the Impact of Demonstration Modality on Imitation Learning,"Li, Haozhuo;Cui, Yuchen;Sadigh, Dorsa","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Learning from Demonstration, Data Sets for Robot Learning","Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for learning robot policies with user-provided data. The way demonstrations are provided, i.e., demonstration modality, influences the quality of the data. While existing research shows that kinesthetic teaching (physically guiding the robot) is preferred by users for the intuitiveness and ease of use, the majority of existing manipulation datasets were collected through teleoperation via a VR controller or spacemouse. In this work, we investigate how different demonstration modalities impact downstream learning performance as well as user experience. Specifically, we compare low-cost demonstration modalities including kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation with a VR controller, and teleoperation with a spacemouse controller. We experiment with three table-top manipulation tasks with different motion constraints. We evaluate and compare imitation learning performance using data from different demonstration modalities, and collected subjective feedback on user experience. Our results show that kinesthetic teaching is rated the most intuitive for controlling the robot and provides cleanest data for best downstream learning performance. However, it is not preferred as the way for large-scale data collection due to the physical load. Based on such insight, we propose a simple data collection scheme that relies on a small number of kinesthetic demonstrations mixed with data collected through teleoperation to achieve the best overall learning performance while maintaining low data-collection effort.",,,,,,

The human operator's performance plays a key role in the success of any teleoperation task, with prior evidence suggesting that operator stress and workload can impact task performance. As robot teleoperation is currently deployed in safety-critical domains, it is essential to analyze how different stress and workload levels impact the operator. We are unaware of any prior work investigating how both stress and workload impact teleoperation performance. We conducted a novel study (n=24) to jointly manipulate users' stress and workload and analyze the user's performance through objective and subjective measures. Our results indicate that, as stress increased, over 70% of our participants performed better up to a moderate level of stress; yet, the majority of participants performed worse as the workload increased.

Teleoperation,Adaptive User Interface with Parallel Neural Networks for Robot Teleoperation,"SharafianArdakani, Payman;Hanafy, Mohamed A.;Kondaurova, Irina;Ashary, Ali;Rayguru, Madan Mohan;Popa, Dan","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Human Performance Augmentation, Virtual Reality and Interfaces","Abstract: In recent years, human-robot interaction (HRI) has become an increasingly important field of research. The human experience during HRI tasks like teleoperation or turn-taking largely depends on the interface design between the robot and the user. Designing an intuitive user interface (UI) between an arbitrary M-dimensional input device and an N-degree of freedom (DOF) robot remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel UI design approach named the Parallel Neural Networks Adaptive User Interface (PNNUI). PNNUI utilizes two parallel neural networks to learn and then improve the teleoperation performance of users by minimizing task completion time and maximizing motion smoothness. Our method is designed to learn an unintuitive input-output map between user interface hardware and the robot by minimizing task completion time in an offline unsupervised learning scheme based on Neural Networks (NNs) and Genetic Algorithms. Secondly, PNNUI minimizes teleoperation jerk online by adapting the weights of a parallel neural network. We experimentally evaluated the resulting UI for teleoperating a 3-DOF nonholonomic robot through a conventional joystick with three inputs. Twenty human subjects operated the robot along an obstacle course in several conditions. The statistical analysis of the user trial data shows that PNNUI improves the human experience in robot teleoperation by maximizing smoothness while maintaining the completion time of the offline learning scheme. Furthermore, the abstract nature of our formulation enables the customization of performance measures, which extends its applicability to other interface devices and HRI tasks, particularly those that are not intuitive to start with.",,,,,,

Such tasks require policies to effectively manage severe occlusions among objects and continually produce precise actions based on visual observations. We propose a vision-based Hierarchical policy for Cluttered-scene Long-horizon Manipulation (HCLM). It employs a high-level policy and three options to select and instantiate three parameterized action primitives: push, pick, and place. We first train the two-stream pick and place options by behavior cloning (BC). Subsequently, we use hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to train the high-level policy and push option. During HRL, we propose a Spatially Extended Q-update (SEQ) to augment the updates for the push option and a Two-Stage Update Scheme (TSUS) to alleviate the non-stationary transition problem in updating the high-level policy. We demonstrate that HCLM significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and efficiency in diverse tasks both in simulation and real world.

Reinforcement Learning 1,Multi-Type Preference Learning: Empowering Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Equal Preferences,"Liu, Ziang;Xu, Junjie;Wu, XingJiao;Yang, Jing;He, Liang","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Preference-Based reinforcement learning (PBRL) learns directly from the preferences of human teachers regarding agent behaviors without needing meticulously designed reward functions. However, existing PBRL methods often learn primarily from explicit preferences, neglecting the possibility that teachers may choose equal preferences. This neglect may hinder the understanding of the agent regarding the task perspective of the teacher, leading to the loss of important information. To address this issue, we introduce the Equal Preference Learning Task, which optimizes the neural network by promoting similar reward predictions when the behaviors of two agents are labeled as equal preferences. Building on this task, we propose a novel PBRL method, Multi-Type Preference Learning (MTPL), which allows simultaneous learning from equal preferences while leveraging existing methods for learning from explicit preferences. To validate our approach, we design experiments applying MTPL to four existing state-of-the-art baselines across ten locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. The experimental results indicate that simultaneous learning from both equal and explicit preferences enables the PBRL method to more comprehensively understand the feedback from teachers, thereby enhancing feedback efficiency.

Reinforcement Learning 1,SuPLE: Robot Learning with Lyapunov Rewards,"Nguyen, Phu;Polani, Daniel;Tiomkin, Stas","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: The reward function is an essential component in robot learning. Reward directly affects the sample and computational complexity of learning, and the quality of a solution. The design of informative rewards requires domain knowledge, which is not always available. We use the properties of the dynamics to produce system-appropriate reward without adding external assumptions. Specifically, we explore an approach to utilize the Lyapunov exponents of the system dynamics to generate a system-immanent reward. We demonstrate that the Sum of the Positive Lyapunov Exponents (SuPLE) is a strong candidate for the design of such a reward. We develop a computational framework for the derivation of this reward, and demonstrate its effectiveness on classical benchmarks for sample-based stabilization of various dynamical systems. It eliminates the need to start the training trajectories at arbitrary states, also known as auxiliary exploration. While the latter is a common practice in simulated robot learning, it is unpractical to consider to use it in real robotic systems, since they typically start from natural rest states such as a pendulum at the bottom, a robot on the ground, etc. and can not be easily initialized at arbitrary states. Comparing the performance of SuPLE to commonly-used reward functions, we observe that the latter fail to find a solution without auxiliary exploration, even for the task of swinging up the double pendulum and keeping it stable at the upright position, a prototypical scenario for multi- linked robots. SuPLE-induced rewards for robot learning offer a novel route for effective robot learning in typical as opposed to highly specialized or fine-tuned scenarios.

Reinforcement Learning 1,SpeedTuning: Speeding up Policy Execution with Lightweight Reinforcement Learning,"Yuan, David D.;Zhao, Zihao;Burns, Kaylee;Finn, Chelsea","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: While learned robotic policies hold promise for advancing generalizable manipulation, their practical deployment is often hindered by suboptimal execution speeds. Imitation learning policies are inherently limited by hardware constraints and the speed of the operator during data collection. In addition, there are no established methods for accelerating policies learned via imitation, and the empirical relationship between execution speed and task success remains underexplored. To address these issues, we introduce SpeedTuning, a reinforcement learning framework specifically designed to enhance the speed of manipulation policies. SpeedTuning learns to predict the optimal execution speed for actions, thereby complementing a base policy without necessitating additional data collection. We provide empirical evidence that SpeedTuning achieves substantial improvements in execution speed, exceeding 2.4x speed-up, while preserving an adequate success rate compared to both the original task policy and straightforward speed-up methods such as linear interpolation at a fixed speed. We evaluate our approach across a diverse set of dynamic and precise tasks, including pouring, throwing, and picking, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in enhancing real-world robotic manipulation.

The average reward criterion allows the use of a simple reward function by naturally promoting the long-term goals, at the same time MaxEnt RL encourages the robustness of the policy. We validate our approach through simulations, consistently outperforming standard RL baselines and traditional control methods. Also, we provide preliminary test results on real double pendulum hardware. Additional experiments on MuJoCo environments further demonstrate AR-EAPO's efficacy on general continuous control tasks.

Learning Based Planning for Manipulation 1,Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Non-Prehensile Manipulation,"Wang, Dexin;Liu, Chunsheng;Chang, Faliang;Huan, Hengqiang;Cheng, Kun","Keywords: Grasping, Manipulation Planning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Manipulating objects without grasping them facilitates complex tasks, known as non-prehensile manipulation. Most previous methods are limited to learning a single skill to manipulate objects with primitive shapes, and are unserviceable for flexible object manipulation that requires a combination of multiple skills. We explore skill-unconstrained non-prehensile manipulation, and propose a Multi-stage Reinforcement Learning for Non-prehensile Manipulation (MRLNM), which calculates a intermediate state between the initial and goal states and divides the task into multiple stages for sequential learning. At each stage, the policy takes the desired 6-DOF object pose as the goal, and proposes a spatially-continuous action, allowing the robot to explore arbitrary skills to accomplish the task. To handle objects with different shapes, we propose a State-Goal Fusion Representation (SGF-Representation) to represent observations and goals as point clouds with motion, which improves the policy's perception of scene layout and task goal. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a Spatially-Reachable Distance Metric (SR-Distance) to approximately measure the shortest distance between two points without intersecting the scene. We evaluate MRLNM on an occluded grasping task which aims to grasp the object in initially occluded configurations. MRLNM demonstrates strong generalization to unseen objects with shapes outside the training distribution and can be transferred to the real world with zero-shot transfer, achieving a 95% success rate.",,,,,,

Given a language instruction and a point cloud of the scene, our framework initiates a hierarchical planning procedure, whereby a language model generates a high-level plan and a sampling-based planner produces constraint-satisfying continuous parameters for manipulation primitives sequenced according to the high-level plan. Key to our approach is the use of a relational dynamics model as a unifying interface between the continuous and symbolic representations of states and actions, thus facilitating language-driven planning from high-dimensional perceptual input such as point clouds. Whereas previous relational dynamics models require training on datasets of multi-step manipulation scenarios that align with the intended test scenarios, Points2Plans uses only single-step simulated training data while generalizing zero-shot to a variable number of steps during real-world evaluations. We evaluate our approach on tasks involving geometric reasoning, multi-object interactions, and occluded object reasoning in both simulated and real-world settings. Results demonstrate that Points2Plans offers strong generalization to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world, where it solves over 85% of evaluated tasks while the next best baseline solves only 50%.",,,,,,

Second, as regards the energy prior definition, we prove a polynomial structure of the kinetic and potential energy, and we derive a polynomial kernel that encodes this property. As a consequence, the proposed model allows also to estimate the kinetic and potential energy without requiring any label on these quantities.

A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step.

Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Navigation 1,CAFE-AD: Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving,"Zhang, Junrui;Wang, Chenjie;Peng, Jie;Li, Haoyu;Ji, Jianmin;Zhang, Yu;Zhang, Yanyong","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Motion and Path Planning, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: Imitation learning based planning tasks on the nuPlan dataset have gained great interest due to their potential to generate human-like driving behaviors. However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD, on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Navigation 1,Beyond Simulation: Benchmarking World Models for Planning and Causality in Autonomous Driving,"Schofield, Hunter;Elmahgiubi, Mohammed;Rezaee, Kasra;Shan, Jinjun","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Autonomous Agents, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.",,,,,,
Testing and Validation,Enhancing Repeatability and Reliability of Accelerated Risk Assessment in Robot Testing,"Capito, Linda;Castillo, Guillermo A.;Weng, Bowen","Keywords: Probability and Statistical Methods, Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking, Legged Robots","Abstract: Risk assessment of a robot in controlled environments, such as laboratories and proving grounds, is a common means to assess, certify, validate, verify, and characterize the robots' safety performance before, during, and even after their commercialization in the real-world. A standard testing program that acquires the risk estimate is expected to be (i) repeatable, such that it obtains similar risk assessments of the same testing subject among multiple trials or attempts with the similar testing effort by different stakeholders, and (ii) reliable against a variety of testing subjects produced by different vendors and manufacturers. Both repeatability and reliability are fundamental and crucial for a testing algorithm's validity, fairness, and practical feasibility, especially for standardization. However, these properties are rarely satisfied or ensured, especially as the subject robots become more complex, uncertain, and varied. This issue was present in traditional risk assessments through Monte-Carlo sampling, and remains a bottleneck for the recent accelerated risk assessment methods, primarily those using importance sampling. This study aims to enhance existing accelerated testing frameworks by proposing a new algorithm that provably integrates repeatability and reliability with the already established formality and efficiency. It also features demonstrations assessing the risk of instability from frontal impacts, initiated by push-over disturbances on a controlled inverted pendulum and a 7-DoF planar bipedal robot Rabbit managed by various control algorithms.",,,,,,
Testing and Validation,Learning-Based Bayesian Inference for Testing of Autonomous Systems,"Parashar, Anjali;Yin, Ji;Dawson, Charles;Tsiotras, Panagiotis;Fan, Chuchu","Keywords: Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation, Robot Safety, Hybrid Logical/Dynamical Planning and Verification","Abstract: For the safe operation of robotic systems, it is important to accurately understand its failure modes using prior testing. Hardware testing of robotic infrastructure is known to be slow and costly. Instead, failure prediction in simulation can help to analyze the system before deployment. Conventionally, large-scale naive Monte Carlo simulations are used for testing; however, this method is only suitable for testing average system performance. For safety-critical systems, worst-case performance is more crucial as failures are often rare events, and the size of test batches increases substantially as failures become more rare. Rare-event sampling methods can be helpful; however, they exhibit slow convergence and cannot handle constraints. This research introduces a novel sampling-based testing framework for autonomous systems which bridges these gaps by utilizing a discretized gradient-based second-order Langevin algorithm combined with learning-based techniques for constrained sampling of failure modes. Our method can predict more diverse failures by exploring the search space efficiently and ensures feasibility with respect to temporal and implicit constraints. We demonstrate the use of our testing methodology on two categories of testing problems, via simulations and hardware experiments. Our method discovers up to 2X failures compared to naive Random Walk sampling, with only half of the sample size.",,,,,,
Testing and Validation,Foundation Models for Rapid Autonomy Validation,"Farid, Alec;Schleede, Peter;Huang, Aaron;Heckman, Christoffer","Keywords: Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking, Deep Learning Methods, Representation Learning","Abstract: We are motivated by the problem of autonomous vehicle performance validation. A key challenge is that an autonomous vehicle requires testing in every kind of driving scenario it could encounter, including rare events, to provide a strong case for safety and show there is no edge-case pathological behavior. Autonomous vehicle companies rely on potentially millions of miles driven in realistic simulation to expose the driving stack to enough miles to estimate rates and severity of collisions. To address scalability and coverage, we propose the use of a behavior foundation model, specifically a masked autoencoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct driving scenarios. We leverage the foundation model in two complementary ways: we (i) use the learned embedding space to group qualitatively similar scenarios together and (ii) fine-tune the model to label scenario difficulty based on the likelihood of a collision upon simulation. We use the difficulty scoring as importance weighting for the groups of scenarios. The result is an approach which can more rapidly estimate the rates and severity of collisions by prioritizing hard scenarios while ensuring exposure to every kind of driving scenario.",,,,,,

It is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular learning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for tuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can track higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the robot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class of robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based control algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in the video of our experiments.",,,,,,

Our framework generates counterfactual collisions with diverse crash properties, e.g., crash angle and velocity, between an adversary and a target vehicle by adding perturbations to the adversary's predicted trajectory from a learned AV behavior model. Our main contribution is to ground these adversarial perturbations in realistic behavior as defined through the lens of data-alignment in the behavior model's parameter space. Then, we cluster these synthetic counterfactuals to identify plausible and representative collision scenarios to form the basis of a test suite for downstream AV system evaluation.

While prior work included some description of particular choices for this grounding, our contribution treats this aspect as a first-class citizen: we introduce notation to deal with a large class of problems, and examine how the grounding affects what tasks can be posed.

Transfer and Continual Learning,M2Distill: Multi-Modal Distillation for Lifelong Imitation Learning,"Roy, Kaushik;Dissanayake, Akila;Tidd, Brendan;Moghadam, Peyman","Keywords: Continual Learning, Incremental Learning, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.",,,,,,

Masked Point Modeling (MPM), owing to its powerful representational capabilities, has become the mainstream point cloud self-supervised learning method. However, existing MPM-based methods often suffer from the problem of negative transfer, due to the disparity in semantic distribution between upstream data and downstream data. To address this issue, we propose an expert enhancement strategy for existing MPM-based methods. Specifically, we insert a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) layer after each block of the backbone network, which utilizes a multi-branch expert architecture with routers that allocate data of different semantics to the appropriate experts for analysis. During the pre-training phase, our expert-enhanced model not only learns universal 3D representations for the backbone network but also acquires powerful semantic routing capabilities for all expert layers. In the fine-tuning phase, we freeze all backbones and conduct end-to-end fine-tuning solely on our expert layers to adaptively select multiple experts most relevant to the semantics of each downstream data for analysis. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially outperforming baseline (Point-MAE) by 5.16%, 5.86%, and 4.62% in three variants of ScanObjectNN while utilizing only 12% of its trainable parameters.

Transfer and Continual Learning,3D Dense Captioning Via Prototypical Momentum Distillation,"Mi, Jinpeng;Wang, Ying;Jin, Shaofei;Zhang, Shiming;Wei, Xian;Zhang, Jianwei","Keywords: Transfer Learning, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: 3D dense captioning aims to describe the crucial regions in 3D visual scenes in the form of natural language. Recent prevailing approaches achieve promising results by leveraging complicated structures incorporated with large-scale models, which necessitate abundant parameters and pose challenges regarding its practical applications. Besides, with limited training data, 3D dense captioners are often susceptible to overfitting, directly degrading caption generation performance. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements in knowledge distillation, we propose a novel approach termed Prototypical Momentum Distillation (PMD) to prompt the model to generate more detailed captions. PMD incorporates Momentum Distillation (MD) with an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-anchored Clustering (UPC) strategy to transfer knowledge by considering the uncertainty of the teacher knowledge. Specifically, we employ the original captioner as the student model and maintain an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) copy of the captioner as the teacher model to impart knowledge as the auxiliary supervision of the student. To abate the misleading caused by uncertain knowledge, we present an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-anchored Clustering (UPC) strategy to cluster the distilled knowledge according to its confidence. We then transfer the rearranged knowledge from the teacher to guide the training route of the student. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on two widely used benchmark datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that PMD outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmarks with MLE training, highlighting its effectiveness.",,,,,,

This challenge is particularly exacerbated for non-rigid systems such as soft robots or robotic systems made of meta-materials with hysteresis. This setting results in a challenging problem for most learning-based controllers that typically rely on the assumption that the system dynamics remain fixed over time. In the absence of explicit mechanisms to account for this change in dynamics, learning-based control algorithms show considerable degradation in performance over time. In this work, we consider a particular class of dynamics shift in under-actuated systems, that is localized to the dynamics of the fully actuated robot itself, while independently leaving the dynamics of the environment unchanged. This captures real-world phenomena such as fatigue or hysteresis in robotic systems. In this setting, we propose an efficient algorithm that can account for dynamics shift. Using a simple calibration procedure, we propose a technique for learning a non-linear ``action-translation"" model that can capture the localized shift in dynamics. This enables continual learning and transfer despite considerable dynamics shift during the learning process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure on several tasks in simulation, as well as a real-world robotic system - a 4 DoF electrically driven handed shearing auxetic (HSA) platform.",,,,,,

We propose two approaches for providing depth prediction models the ability to see through translucent barriers: removing translucent barriers through image inpainting before passing to standard depth prediction models as input, and directly training depth models with images with translucent barriers. We show that image inpainting allows standard learned monocular and stereo depth estimation models to achieve 3 cm MAE for predicting depth of shelved items behind plastic, whereas training with real images with translucent barriers allows them to achieve centimeter or sub-centimeter MAE.

Experiments show that the surface contact shape recovered is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with those obtained through the use of photometric stereo, the current state of the art for shape recovery in visual-tactile sensors. Importantly, our approach is applicable to a large family of sensors not equipped with photometric stereo hardware, and also to those with semi-transparent membranes. The recovery of surface shape affords new capabilities to these sensors for robotic applications, such as the estimation of contact and slippage in object manipulation tasks and the use of force matching for kinesthetic teaching using multimodal visual-tactile sensing.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots 2,STHN: Deep Homography Estimation for UAV Thermal Geo-Localization with Satellite Imagery,"Xiao, Jiuhong;Zhang, Ning;Tortei, Daniel;Loianno, Giuseppe","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Aerial Systems: Applications, Localization","Abstract: Accurate geo-localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for outdoor applications including search and rescue operations, power line inspections, and environmental monitoring. The vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals to interference and spoofing necessitates the development of additional robust localization methods for autonomous navigation. Visual Geo-localization (VG), leveraging onboard cameras and reference satellite maps, offers a promising solution for absolute localization. Specifically, Thermal Geo-localization (TG), which relies on image-based matching between thermal imagery with satellite databases, stands out by utilizing infrared cameras for effective nighttime localization. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of current TG approaches, are hindered by dense sampling on satellite maps and geometric noises in thermal query images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STHN, a novel UAV thermal geo-localization approach that employs a coarse-to-fine deep homography estimation method. This method attains reliable thermal geo-localization within a 512-meter radius of the UAV's last known location even with a challenging 11% size ratio between thermal and satellite images, despite the presence of indistinct textures and self-similar patterns. We further show how our research significantly enhances UAV thermal geo-localization performance and robustness against geometric noises under low-visibility conditions in the wild.

Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional vision-based navigation via independent mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to be effective for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all speeds. We assess performance at speeds of 1-7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.",,,,,,

These factors hinder performance and compromise the stability of the system, making precise control challenging. Existing model-based approaches either make deterministic assumptions, utilize Gaussian-based representations of uncertainty, or rely on nominal models, all of which often fall short in capturing the complex, multimodal nature of real-world dynamics. This work introduces DroneDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to learn quadrotor dynamics, formulated as a sequence generation task. DroneDiffusion achieves superior generalization to unseen, complex scenarios by capturing the temporal nature of uncertainties and mitigating error propagation.

However, existing simulators often lack high-level autonomy, hindering their immediate applicability to complex tasks such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments. This limitation stems from the challenge of integrating realistic physics, photorealistic rendering, and diverse sensor modalities into a single simulation environment. At the same time, the existing photorealistic UAV simulators use mostly hand-crafted environments with limited environment sizes, which prevents the testing of long-range missions. This restricts the usage of existing simulators to only low-level tasks such as control and collision avoidance. To this end, we propose the novel FlightForge UAV open-source simulator. FlightForge offers advanced rendering capabilities, diverse control modalities, and, foremost, procedural generation of environments. Moreover, the simulator is already integrated with a fully autonomous UAV system capable of long-range flights in cluttered unknown environments.

When modeling environmental phenomena with a robot, gathering high resolution information can be resource intensive. Actively gathering data and modeling flows with the data is a more efficient alternative. However, in such scenarios, data is often sparse and thus requires flow modeling techniques that are effective at capturing the relevant dynamical features of the flow to ensure high prediction accuracy of the resulting models. To accomplish this effectively, regions with high informative value must be identified. We propose EnKode, an active sampling approach based on Koopman Operator theory and ensemble methods that can build high quality flow models and effectively estimate model uncertainty. For modeling complex flows, EnKode provides comparable or better estimates of unsampled flow regions than Gaussian Process Regression models with hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, our active sensing scheme provides more accurate flow estimates than comparable strategies that rely on uniform sampling.

As a permanent magnetic (PM) actuation system, the Halbach array can provide strong and controllable magnetic fields with large motion workspace. However, existing cylindrical Halbach array systems can only generate axial force along its central axis and require the workspace (i.e., patient anatomy) to be manipulated inside the system for any useful robot manipulation, severely limiting their application for robotic surgery. In this work, we introduce a cylindrical Halbach array actuation system capable of generating a magnetic field with longitudinal gradients across a 2-dimensional (2D) workplane instead of only along the central axis, effectively extending the longitudinal force actuation coverage from 1D to a 2D plane. This is achieved by optimizing the magnet sizes and roll angles of the Halbach rows arranged circumferentially around the system. Co-alignment between the field and gradient directions is also achieved through proper configuration of the magnet pitch angles along each Halbach row, resulting in tip-leading robot motion capability. A series of model-based simulations were performed during the optimization process and later verified experimentally. The actuation system was experimentally demonstrated to stably drive a 2mm diameter magnetic robot longitudinally at different locations within the workplane and at different velocities.

Damaging the interlobar fissures during surgery can have serious consequences. Accurately segmenting weak and abnormal fissures commonly found in clinical CT scans remains a challenging task. To solve the above problem, we aimed to develop a novel Convolution Transformer for accurate fissure segmentation (SC-Former).

Motion Planning 2,Propagative Distance Optimization for Motion Planning,"Chen, Yu;Xu, Jinyun;Cai, Yilin;Wong, Ting-Wei;Ren, Zhongqiang;Choset, Howie;Shi, Guanya","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Constrained Motion Planning","Abstract: This paper focuses on the motion planning problem for serial articulated robots with revolute joints under kinematic constraints. Many motion planners leverage iterative local optimization methods but are often trapped in local minima due to non-convexity of the problem. A key reason for the non-convexity is the trigonometric term when parameterizing the kinematics using joint angles. Recent distance-based formulation can eliminate these trigonometric terms by formulating the kinematics based on distances, and has shown superior performance against classic joint angle based formulations in domains like inverse kinematics (IK). However, distance-based kinematics formulations have not yet been studied for motion planning, and naively applying them for motion planning may lead to poor computational efficiency. In particular, IK seeks one configuration while motion planning seeks a sequence of configurations, which greatly increases the scale of the underlying optimization problem. This paper proposes Propagative Distance Optimization for Motion Planning (PDOMP), which addresses the challenge by (i) introducing a new compact representation that reduces the number of variables in the distance-based formulation, and (ii) leveraging the chain structure to efficiently compute forward kinematics and Jacobians of the robot among waypoints along a path.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 2,Dynamically Feasible Path Planning in Cluttered Environments Via Reachable B'ezier Polytopes,"Csomay-Shanklin, Noel;Compton, William;Ames, Aaron","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Optimization and Optimal Control, Legged Robots","Abstract: The deployment of robotic systems in real world environments requires the ability to quickly produce paths through cluttered, non-convex spaces. These planned trajectories must be both kinematically feasible (i.e., collision free) and dynamically feasible (i.e., satisfy the underlying system dynamics), necessitating a consideration of both the free space and the dynamics of the robot in the path planning phase. In this work, we explore the application of reachable Bezier polytopes as an efficient tool for generating trajectories satisfying both kinematic and dynamic requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by offloading specific computation tasks to the GPU, such an algorithm can meet tight real time requirements. We propose a layered control architecture that efficiently produces collision free and dynamically feasible paths for nonlinear control systems, and demonstrate the framework on the tasks of 3D hopping in a cluttered environment.",,,,,,

This involves fusing compressed, intermittent, limited, heterogeneous, and asynchronous environmental information across multiple robots to enhance overall perception, despite challenges like sensor noise, occlusions, and sensor failures. One major hurdle has been the lack of real-world datasets. This paper presents a pioneering and comprehensive real-world multi-robot collaborative perception dataset to boost research in this area. Our dataset leverages the untapped potential of air-ground robot collaboration featuring distinct spatial viewpoints, complementary robot mobilities, coverage ranges, and sensor modalities. It features raw sensor inputs, pose estimation, and optional high-level perception annotation, thus accommodating diverse research interests. Compared to existing datasets predominantly designed for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), our setup ensures a diverse range and adequate overlap of sensor views to facilitate the study of multi-robot collaborative perception algorithms.

Multi-Robot Systems 1,Scenario-Based Curriculum Generation for Multi-Agent Driving,"Brunnbauer, Axel;Berducci, Luigi;Priller, Peter;Nickovic, Dejan;Grosu, Radu","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Software Tools for Benchmarking and Reproducibility","Abstract: The automated generation of diversified training scenarios has been an important ingredient in many complex learning tasks, especially in real-world application domains such as autonomous driving, where auto-curriculum generation is considered vital for obtaining robust and general policies. However, crafting traffic scenarios with multiple, heterogeneous agents is typically considered a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in more complex simulation environments. To this end, we introduce MATS-Gym, a multi-agent training framework for autonomous driving that uses partial-scenario specifications to generate traffic scenarios with a variable number of agents which are executed in CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator. MATS-Gym reconciles scenario execution engines, such as Scenic and ScenarioRunner, with established multi-agent training frameworks where the interaction between the environment and the agents is modeled as a partially observable stochastic game. Furthermore, we integrate MATS-Gym with techniques from unsupervised environment design to automate the generation of adaptive auto-curricula, which is the first application of such algorithms to the domain of autonomous driving.

Multi-Robot Systems 1,Multi-Robot Collaboration through Reinforcement Learning and Abstract Simulation,"Labiosa, Adam;Hanna, Josiah","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Cooperating Robots, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Teams of people coordinate to perform complex tasks by forming abstract mental models of world and agent dynamics. The use of abstract models contrasts with much recent work in robot learning that uses a high-fidelity simulator and reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain policies for physical robots. Motivated by this difference, we investigate the extent to which so-called abstract simulators can be used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the resulting policies successfully deployed on teams of physical robots. An abstract simulator models the robot's target task at a high-level of abstraction and discards many details of the world that could impact optimal decision-making. Policies are trained in an abstract simulator then transferred to the physical robot by making use of separately-obtained low-level perception and motion control modules. We identify three key categories of modifications to the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots: simulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation stochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to determine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer in cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies produced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior architecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach leads to a similar level of performance. Broadly we show that MARL can be use to train cooperative physical robot behaviors using highly abstract models of the world.",,,,,,

However, under such systems, a potential challenge exists where the operator, upon switching locations, may need to join ongoing conversations without a complete understanding of their history. Consequently, a seamless transition and the development of high-quality conversations may be impeded. This study directs its attention to the utilization of multiple robots, aiming to create a semiautonomous teleoperation system. This system enables an operator to switch between twin robots at each location as needed, thereby facilitating the provision of higher-quality dialogue services simultaneously. As an initial phase, a field experiment was conducted to assess user satisfaction with recommendations made by the operator using twin robots.

In this work, we use the Human-Object-Human (HOH) dataset, consisting of H2H interactions performed by 20 giver-receiver pairs with 136 objects, to conduct an R2H study with 34 objects. We teleoperate a Kinova Gen3 manipulator to grip an object as grasped by an HOH human giver, and program it to automatically transport and orient the object to a participant by mimicking the HOH giver's trajectory and transfer pose. We survey participants on safety, naturalness, and preferred choice over linear trajectory and random orientation baselines. We find that transfer pose influences perceptions of naturalness, with HOH poses showing higher naturalness ratings.

This was investigated in a pilot study using two inter-robot collaboration modalities and interface tools, which required different human-robot interaction techniques to execute a mission with a team of four robots. In the first modality, the operator manually inserted waypoints for each robot, as they acted as individual agents. In the second modality, the operator used the Planning Execution to After-Action Review (PETAAR) toolset to plot a single waypoint for the team of robots, as the robots coordinated their movement as a group. One novel component of this study is the investigation of how human-robot teaming dynamics and the PETAAR toolset impacted robot operators' real-time situation awareness and perceived cognitive load as well as team performance. Although the teaming modalities differed greatly with respect to the level of operator input needed, the time required to complete the simulation, the participantÂ’s perceived cognitive load, and interface usability were very similar for both modalities. In contrast, the results revealed statistically significant differences between the two teaming modalities related to participantsÂ’ abilities to maintain a wedge formation while remaining situationally aware.

Calibration 2,CoL3D: Collaborative Learning of Single-View Depth and Camera Intrinsics for Metric 3D Shape Recovery,"Zhang, Chenghao;Fan, Lubin;Cao, Shen;Wu, Bojian;Ye, Jieping","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, RGB-D Perception, Calibration and Identification","Abstract: Recovering the metric 3D shape from a single image is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied intelligence applications, where accurate spatial understanding is crucial for navigation and interaction with environments. Usually, the mainstream approaches achieve it through monocular depth estimation. However, without camera intrinsics, the 3D metric shape can not be recovered from depth alone. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that depth serves as a 3D prior constraint for estimating camera intrinsics and uncover the reciprocal relations between these two elements. Motivated by this, we propose a collaborative learning framework for jointly estimating depth and camera intrinsics, named CoL3D, to learn metric 3D shapes from single images. Specifically, CoL3D adopts a unified network and performs collaborative optimization at three levels: depth, camera intrinsics, and 3D point clouds. For camera intrinsics, we design a canonical incidence field mechanism as a prior that enables the model to learn the residual incident field for enhanced calibration. Additionally, we incorporate a shape similarity measurement loss in the point cloud space, which improves the quality of 3D shapes essential for robotic applications. As a result, when training and testing on a single dataset with in-domain settings, CoL3D delivers outstanding performance in both depth estimation and camera calibration across several indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets, which leads to remarkable 3D shape quality for the perception capabilities of robots.",,,,,,

Recent advancements in markerless pose estimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups for camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible within the camera's field of view. However, in practice robots usually move in and out of view and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the whole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the Vision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and integrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated on both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to demonstrate our robustness and generalizability.

Traditional methods using markers for hand-eye calibration require offline image collection, limiting their suitability for online self-calibration.

This work proposes a Foundation feature-driven online End-Effector Pose Estimation (FEEPE) algorithm, characterized by its training-free and cross-end-effector generalization capabilities. Inspired by the zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models, FEEPE leverages pre-trained visual features to estimate 2D-3D correspondences derived from CAD models and reference images, enabling 6D pose estimation via the PnP algorithm. To resolve ambiguities from partial observations and symmetry, a multihistorical key frame enhanced pose optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing temporal information for improved accuracy.

Indeed, a societal long-term impact is expected in home-care assistance with the deployment of intelligent robotic interfaces. This work presents a human-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments, such as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The proposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which utilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the laser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide the robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate objects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head, enabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that point the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural network based perception module. The interface implements two control modalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly, commanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard with buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These buttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the action of the gripper.

We developed a wearable assistive robot that can directly measure contact force and investigated the gravity compensation effect of contact-force-based control. For conventional robots that do not measure the force acting between the robot and the human body (contact force) directly, a precise robot model is required for gravity compensation, which is difficult to implement in software. In the first experiment, we examined a method of gravity compensation using only joint sensors in torque-based control, which is a common conventional method, and assessed the difficulty of this method. In the next experiment, which involved one healthy subject, we confirmed that contact-force-based control has a significant gravity compensation effect without requiring a rigorous robot model. Experiments with two additional healthy subjects using the same parameters revealed that even rough parameter tuning can produce a gravity compensation effect.

Wearable Robotics 1,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Gait State Estimation,"Medrano, Roberto;Thomas, Gray;Rouse, Elliott","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: Exoskeleton controllers have recently employed machine learning (ML) techniques to provide appropriate assistance throughout the terrains of the real world. One successful approach has been to learn a mapping between an exoskeleton wearer's kinematic measurements and a gait state vector that encodes how the wearer is currently walking (i.e. gait phase, speed), and then dynamically update the assistance based on the gait state. However, these methods require paired datasets of input kinematics to output gait states, which usually involves manual, time-consuming labeling of data from participants wearing specific exoskeletons and thus limits the scalability of these ML methods. A prior solution to this challenge---leveraging large pre-labeled datasets of normative human walking---introduces another problem, in that networks trained on these datasets learn only normative locomotion patterns, and thus may deteriorate when the data are changed by wearing the exoskeleton itself. In this context, we present an unsupervised-learning-based approach to both bypass the requirement of labeled data for gait state prediction and address the difficulty of domain adaptation from normative to exoskeleton-assisted walking. We validate our method in a set of walking simulations that featured exoskeleton data from 14 participants. This model showed significant improvements in state estimation relative to a model trained solely on pre-labeled normative walking, while also not requiring ground truth labels. This work presents a foundation that demonstrates labeled, device-specific data may not be required for predicting walking behavior in real time.",,,,,,

However, UWB radar's ability to capture sensitive physiological data, even through walls, raises significant privacy concerns, particularly in human-robot interactions and autonomous systems that rely on radar for sensing human presence and physiological functions. In this paper, we present Anti-Sensing, a novel defense mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized radar-based sensing. Our approach introduces physically realizable perturbations, such as oscillatory motion from wearable devices, to disrupt radar sensing by mimicking natural cardiac motion, thereby misleading heart rate (HR) estimations. We develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the frequency and spatial amplitude of these oscillations for maximal disruption while ensuring physiological plausibility. Through both simulations and real-world experiments with radar data and neural network-based HR sensing models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Anti-Sensing in significantly degrading model accuracy, offering a practical solution for privacy preservation.",,,,,,
Wearable Robotics 1,Vision-Based Fuzzy Control System with Intention Detection for Smart Walkers: Enhancing Usability for Stroke Survivors with Unilateral Upper Limb Impairments,"Abdollah Chalaki, Mahdi;Zakerimanesh, Amir;Soleymani, Abed;Mushahwar, Vivian K.;Tavakoli, Mahdi","Keywords: Rehabilitation Robotics, Medical Robots and Systems, Physical Human-Robot Interaction","Abstract: Mobility impairments, particularly those caused by stroke-induced hemiparesis, significantly impact independence and quality of life. Current smart walker controllers operate by using input forces from the user to control linear motion and input torques to dictate rotational movement; however, because they predominantly rely on user-applied torque exerted on the device handle as an indicator of user intent to turn, they fail to adequately accommodate users with unilateral upper limb impairments. This leads to increased physical strain and cognitive load. This paper introduces a novel smart walker equipped with a fuzzy control algorithm that leverages shoulder abduction angles to intuitively interpret user intentions using just one functional hand. By integrating a force sensor and stereo camera, the system enhances walker responsiveness, usability, and safety. Experimental evaluations with five participants demonstrated that the fuzzy controller significantly reduced wrist torque and improved user comfort compared to traditional admittance controllers. Results confirmed a strong correlation between shoulder abduction angles and directional intent, with users reporting decreased effort and enhanced ease of use. This study contributes to assistive robotics by providing an adaptable control mechanism for smart walkers, suggesting a pathway towards enhancing mobility and independence for individuals with mobility impairments.

Wearable Robotics 1,Towards Shape-Adaptive Attachment Design for Wearable Devices Using Granular Jamming,"Brignone, Joseph;Lancaster, Logan;Battaglia, Edoardo;Zhang, Haohan","Keywords: Wearable Robotics, Soft Robot Applications","Abstract: Attaching a wearable device to the user's body for comfort and function while accommodating the differences and changes in body shapes often represents a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses this problem through granular jamming, where a granule-filled membrane stiffens by rapidly decreasing the internal air pressure (e.g., vacuum), causing the granule material to be jammed together due to friction. This structure was used to conform to complex shapes of the human body when it is in the soft state while switching to the rigid state for proper robot functions by jamming the granules via vacuum. We performed an experiment to systematically investigate the effect of multiple design parameters on the ability of such jamming-based interfaces to hold against a lateral force. Specifically, we developed a bench prototype where modular granular-jamming structures are attached to objects of different sizes and shapes via a downward suspension force. Our data showed that the use of jamming is necessary to increase the overall structure stability by 1.73 to 2.16 N. Furthermore, using three modules, high suspension force, and a low membrane infill (~25%) also contribute to high resistance to lateral force. Our results lay a foundation for future implementation of wearable attachments using granular-jamming structures.",,,,,,

However, existing efforts suffer from inefficiency in terms of inference speed and accuracy, limiting their practical applicability. We present EPRecon, an efficient real-time panoptic 3D reconstruction framework. Current volumetric-based reconstruction methods usually utilize multi-view depth map fusion to obtain scene depth priors, which is time-consuming and poses challenges to real-time scene reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight module to directly estimate scene depth priors in a 3D volume for reconstruction quality improvement by generating occupancy probabilities of all voxels. In addition, compared with existing panoptic segmentation methods, EPRecon extracts panoptic features from both voxel features and corresponding image features, obtaining more detailed and comprehensive instance-level semantic information and achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate the superiority of EPRecon over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both panoptic 3D reconstruction quality and real-time inference.

We address the structural visible gap between NeRF and NDF by utilizing a visible-aware occupancy map to classify space into the free, occupied, visible unknown, and background regions. This classification facilitates the recovery of a complete appearance and structure of the scene. We unify the training of the NDF and NeRF using a spatial-varying scale SDF-to-density transformation for levels of detail for both structure and appearance. The proposed method leverages the learned NDF for structure-aware NeRF training by an adaptive sphere tracing sampling strategy for accurate structure rendering. In return, NeRF further refines structural in recovering missing or fuzzy structures in the NDF.

Existing approaches for producing RGB-colorized maps are primarily based on real-time localization using filter-based estimation or sliding window optimization, which may lack accuracy and global consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel global LiDAR-Visual bundle adjustment (BA) named LVBA to improve the quality of RGB point cloud mapping beyond existing baselines. LVBA first optimizes LiDAR poses via a global LiDAR BA, followed by a photometric visual BA incorporating planar features from the LiDAR point cloud for camera pose optimization. Additionally, to address the challenge of map point occlusions in constructing optimization problems, we implement a novel LiDAR-assisted global visibility algorithm in LVBA. To evaluate the effectiveness of LVBA, we conducted extensive experiments by comparing its mapping quality against existing state-of-the-art baselines (i.e., R3LIVE and FAST-LIVO).

Though we have witnessed recent advancements in implicit neural scene representations enabling precise 2D rendering simply from multi-view images, there have been few works addressing 3D scene understanding with monocular priors alone. In this paper, we propose MOSE, a neural field semantic reconstruction approach to lift inferred image-level noisy priors to 3D, producing accurate semantics and geometry in both 3D and 2D space. The key motivation for our method is to leverage generic class-agnostic segment masks as guidance to promote local consistency of rendered semantics during training. With the help of semantics, we further apply a smoothness regularization to texture-less

The unpredictable behavior and varying physical properties of these objects significantly complicate manipulation tasks. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a novel Reactive Pushing Strategy. This strategy allows a mobile robot to dynamically adjust its base movements in real-time to achieve successful pushing maneuvers towards a target location. Notably, our strategy adapts the robot motion based on changes in contact location obtained through the tactile sensor covering the base, avoiding dependence on object-related assumptions and its modeled behavior. The effectiveness of the Reactive Pushing Strategy was initially evaluated in the simulation environment, where it significantly outperformed the compared baseline approaches. Following this, we validated the proposed strategy through real-world experiments, demonstrating the robot capability to push objects to the target points located in the entire vicinity of the robot.

Recent efforts focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) often depends on careful definition of dense reward functions. This work proposes an effective strategy for such tasks that integrates traditional model-based control with RL to achieve improved insertion accuracy. The policy is trained exclusively in simulation and is zero-shot transferred to the real system. It employs a potential field-based controller to acquire a model-based policy for inserting a plug into a socket given full observability in simulation. This policy is then integrated with residual RL, which is trained in simulation given only a sparse, goal-reaching reward. A curriculum scheme over observation noise and action magnitude is used for training the residual RL policy. Both policy components use as input the SE(3) poses of both the plug and the socket and return the plugÂ’s SE(3) pose transform, which is executed by a robotic arm using a controller. The integrated policy is deployed on the real system without further training or fine-tuning, given a visual SE(3) object tracker.

More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs).

When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions.

To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the SE_2(3) group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state, and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision.

Localization 1,On Semidefinite Relaxations for Matrix-Weighted State-Estimation Problems in Robotics,"Holmes, Connor;DÃ¼mbgen, Frederike;Barfoot, Timothy","Keywords: SLAM, Localization, Optimization and Optimal Control, Certifiable","Abstract: In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. To better understand this issue, we introduce a theoretical connection between the posterior uncertainty of the state estimate and the certificate matrix obtained via convex relaxation. With this connection in mind, we empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain it.

Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system.

Place Recognition 1,Adaptive Thresholding for Sequence-Based Place Recognition,"Vysotska, Olga;Bogoslavskyi, Igor;Hutter, Marco;Stachniss, Cyrill","Keywords: SLAM, Localization, Mapping","Abstract: Robots need to know where they are in the world to operate effectively without human support. One common first step for precise robot localization is visual place recognition. It is a challenging problem, especially when the output is required in an online fashion, and the current state-of-the-art approaches that tackle it usually require either large amounts of labeled training data or rely on parameters that need to be tuned manually, often per dataset. One such parameter often used for sequence-based place recognition is the image similarity threshold that allows to differentiate between pairs of images that represent the same place even in the presence of severe environmental and structural changes, and those that represent different places even if they share a similar appearance. Currently, selecting this threshold is a manual procedure and requires human expertise. We propose an automatic similarity threshold selection technique and integrate it into a complete sequence-based place recognition system. The experiments on a broad range of real-world and simulated data show that our approach is capable of matching image sequences under various illumination, viewpoint and underlying structural changes, runs online, and requires no manual parameter tuning while yielding performance comparable to a manual, dataset-specific parameter tuning. Thus, this paper substantially increases the ease of use of visual place recognition in real-world settings.",,,,,,
Place Recognition 1,RE-TRIP : Reflectivity Instance Augmented Triangle Descriptor for 3D Place Recognition,"Park, Yechan;Pak, Gyuhyeon;Kim, Euntai","Keywords: SLAM, Localization, Mapping","Abstract: While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition (PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP in real-world applications, we further propose (1) keypoint extraction method, (2) key instance segmentation method, (3) RE-TRIP matching method, and (4) reflectivity combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenariosÂ—including long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic environmentsÂ—our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context, Intensity Scan Context and STD.

Place Recognition 1,Context Graph-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition,"Woo, Soojin;Kim, Seong-Woo","Keywords: Localization, AI-Enabled Robotics, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization","Abstract: In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features remains challenging in scenarios with changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data for model training, presenting a significant limitation. To handle variations in appearance, methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been introduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that does not require additional training and remains robust to scene changes. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings from a zero-shot, languagedriven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms non-learned image representation techniques and offthe- shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors.

Tactile Sensing 1,Marker or Markerless? Mode-Switchable Optical Tactile Sensing for Diverse Robot Tasks,"Ou, Ni;Chen, Zhuo;Luo, Shan","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Grasping","Abstract: Optical tactile sensors play a pivotal role in robot perception and manipulation tasks. The membrane of these sensors can be painted with markers or remain markerless, enabling them to function in either marker or markerless mode. However, this uni-modal selection means the sensor is only suitable for either manipulation or perception tasks. While markers are vital for manipulation, they can also obstruct the camera, thereby impeding perception. The dilemma of selecting between marker and markerless modes presents a significant obstacle. To address this issue, we propose a novel mode-switchable optical tactile sensing approach that facilitates transitions between the two modes. The marker-to-markerless transition is achieved through a generative model, whereas its inverse transition is realized using a sparsely supervised regressive model. Our approach allows a single-mode optical sensor to operate effectively in both marker and markerless modes without the need for additional hardware, making it well-suited for both perception and manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. For perception tasks, our approach decreases the number of categories that include misclassified samples by 2 and improves contact area segmentation IoU by 3.53%. For manipulation tasks, our method attains a high success rate of 92.59% in slip detection.

In robotics, microvibrations have traditionally been interpreted as a marker for object slip, and recently as a salient indicator of extrinsic contact. We present the first-ever robotic fingertip making use of SMI for slip and extrinsic contact sensing. The design is validated through measurement of controlled vibration sources, both before and after encasing the readout circuit in its fingertip package. Then, the SMI fingertip is compared to acoustic sensing through four experiments. The results are distilled into a technology decision map.

Tactile Sensing 1,Estimating High-Resolution Neural Stiffness Fields Using Visuotactile Sensors,"Han, Jiaheng;Yao, Shaoxiong;Hauser, Kris",Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing,"Abstract: High-resolution visuotactile sensors provide detailed contact information that is promising to infer the physical properties of objects in contact. This paper introduces a novel technique for high-resolution stiffness estimation of heterogeneous deformable objects using the Punyo bubble sensor. We developed an observation model for dense contact forces to estimate object stiffness using a visuotactile sensor and a dense force estimator. Additionally, we propose a neural volumetric stiffness field (VSF) formulation that represents stiffness as a continuous function, which allows dynamic point sampling at visuotactile sensor observation resolution. The neural VSF significantly reduces artifacts commonly associated with traditional point-based methods, particularly in stiff inclusion estimation and heterogeneous stiffness estimation. We further apply our method in a blind localization task, where objects within opaque bags are accurately modeled and localized, demonstrating the superior performance of neural VSF compared to existing techniques.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing 1,High-Resolution Reconstruction of Non-Planar Tactile Patterns from Low-Resolution Taxel-Based Tactile Sensors,"Zhou, Chen;Zhao, He;Liu, Qian","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Contact Modeling","Abstract: Over the past decades, the development of tactile sensors has gained increasing attention and has gradually become a fundamental device for robots. Especially in today's context where human-robot interaction demands are growing and the requirements for tactile perception are becoming stricter, how to enable robots to better perceive their environment has become a topic worth discussing. Tactile sensors, after years of development, have emerged in two main types: taxel-based and vision-based sensors, where the latter can provide relatively low resolution (LR) tactile patterns compared with the former. Both of them have seen significant enhancements in their tactile perception capabilities on flat and regular surfaces. However, as application scenarios expand, current flat tactile perception can no longer meet the robots' needs for multi-dimensional and complex perception capabilities. Therefore, we investigate the high-resolution (HR) reconstruction of non-planar tactile patterns captured by LR taxel-based sensors in this paper. We first develop a new dataset, where the ground truth of non-planar tactile patterns are obtained with a vision-based GelSight Mini tactile sensor, and the LR data are collected via a commercial taxel-based Xela sensor. In addition, we propose to adapt the state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based tactile super-resolution model of flat/planar surfaces to the non-planar scenario, and also develop a diffusion-based model for the non-planar HR reconstruction. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed models.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing 1,Blind Tactile Exploration for Surface Reconstruction,"Sinha, Yashaswi;Bhattacharya, Soumojit;Sahu, Yash Kumar;Biswas, Pradipta","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: Accurate 3d reconstruction capturing the fine details of an objectÂ’s shape is essential for tasks such as automated assembly, inspection, and quality control. While monocular cameras provide broad visual structure but often miss critical surface details and depth accuracy in underexposed or occluded environments. Tactile sensors offer precise, localized depth information, capturing fine textures, yet exploring varied curvature surfaces with only tactile input remains challenging. To address this, the paper proposes a blind surface exploration method for convex objects using a set of sequential controllers to efficiently guide the manipulator's interaction with surfaces featuring sharp edge changes. This approach ensures precise tactile exploration, leading to highly detailed surface reconstruction. With the controller employed, the algorithm was able to move along the surface while maintaining contact along normal and reconstruct the object with IoU as high as 91% for objects with sharp edges.",,,,,,

This study introduces EIT-GNN, a graph-structured data-driven EIT reconstruction framework that achieves super-resolution in large-area tactile perception on unbounded form factors of robots. EIT-GNN represents the arbitrary sensor shape into mesh connections, then employs a two-fold architecture of transformer encoder and graph convolutional neural network to best manage such the geometrical prior knowledge, resulting in the accurate, generalized, and parameter-efficient reconstruction procedure. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate its application using large-area face-shaped sensor hardware, which represents one of the most complex geometries in human/humanoid anatomy.

Design and Robust Control,Control Reallocation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Actuator Fault Recovery of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Lagattu, Katell;Artusi, Eva;Santos, Paulo E.;Sammut, Karl;Le Chenadec, Gilles;Clement, Benoit","Keywords: Robust/Adaptive Control, Reinforcement Learning, Autonomous Agents","Abstract: Actuator faults in dynamic systems pose significant challenges, particularly for robotic systems operating in hostile environments such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), risking loss of stability and performance degradation. Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) strategies, including Control Reallocation (CR), have been developed to mitigate such risks. However, these strategies extensively depend on explicit fault diagnosis, which may present challenges regarding computational demands and efficiency, particularly when dealing with unknown faults. This paper presents a novel method that performs CR with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for actuator fault recovery without explicit fault diagnosis. The approach is implemented on a BlueROV2 underwater vehicle and demonstrates improved performance for fault recovery compared to a standard Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and a variable gain PID controller, both in simulation and in real-world conditions.

Design and Robust Control,A New Framework for Repetitive Control of Robot Manipulators Via Operator-Theoretic Robust Stabilization,"Song, Geun Il;Kim, Jung Hoon","Keywords: Robust/Adaptive Control, Motion Control, Industrial Robots","Abstract: This paper establishes a new framework for repetitive control of uncertain robot manipulators via operator-theoretic robust stabilization. After applying the inverse dynamics approach to robot manipulators, by which the relevant nonlinear inputslash output behavior is converted to a linear time-invariant (LTI) equation, we take the repetitive control approach. Even though such a repetitive controller is known to achieve high performances for periodic reference inputs, it is quite difficult to derive the stability analysis for the resulting closed-loop systems in a rigorous fashion. To solve this difficulty, we construct an operator-theoretic approach to the repetitive control treatment, and show that the closed-loop systems are exponentially stable if and only if the spectrum radius of the relevant monodromy operator is less than 1. Based on the necessary and sufficient condition, we develop a guideline to take the relevant control parameters. Finally, some experiment results are given to demonstrate the overall arguments developed in this paper.",,,,,,

Our approach introduces a novel Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-guided disturbance for adversarial RL training, where we use interpretable worst-case or near-worst-case disturbances as adversaries against the robust policy. We evaluated its effectiveness across three distinct tasks: a reach-avoid game in both simulation and real-world settings, and a highly dynamic quadrotor stabilization task in simulation. We validate that our learned critic network is consistent with the ground-truth HJ value function, while the policy network shows comparable performance with other learning-based methods.",,,,,,

To achieve robust path following for the autonomous tugboat, this paper proposes an optimal fault-tolerant control scheme. Firstly, we formulate the robust path following of the tugboat as an optimal fault-tolerance control problem. A matrixed error system for the control scheme is constructed to uniformly consider both EODs and ITLEFs. Secondly, considering the time and economic costs associated with algorithm deployment and tuning process on tugboats in real world, we present an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm to solve the proposed optimal fault-tolerance problem, which is characterized by ease of tuning. Then, the stability of the control system is proven based on the Lyapunov criterion. Finally, the proposed control scheme is evaluated under practical conditions with EODs and ITLEFs. The comparative results with backstepping-based control scheme demonstrate that the proposed control scheme exhibits more robustness for path following under EODs and ITLEFs.",,,,,,

Lane departure is the primary reason for half of the fatalities in road accidents, making the development of stable, adaptive and robust controllers a necessity. Traditional linear feedback controllers achieve satisfactory tracking performance, however, they exhibit unstable behavior when uncertainties are induced into the system. Any disturbance or uncertainty introduced to the steering-angle input can be catastrophic for the vehicle. Therefore, controllers must be developed to actively handle such uncertainties. In this work, we introduce a Neural L1 Adaptive controller which learns the uncertainties in the lateral error dynamics of a front-steered Ackermann vehicle and guarantees stability and robustness.

Traditional reinforcement learning methods often assume symmetric costs, which can lead to suboptimal navigation paths and increased safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce QuasiNav, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates quasimetric embeddings to explicitly model asymmetric costs and guide efficient, safe navigation. QuasiNav formulates the navigation problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and employs quasimetric embeddings to capture directionally dependent costs, allowing for a more accurate representation of the terrain. We combine this approach with adaptive constraint tightening. This ensures that safety constraints are dynamically enforced during learning. We validate QuasiNav on a Clearpath Jackal robot in three challenging navigation scenariosÂ—undulating terrains, asymmetric hill traversal, and directionally dependent terrain traversalÂ—demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments.

The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%.

dataset for training the semantic traversability estimator is then automatically generated by extracting semantically traversable regions in each video frame using a recent foundation model in image segmentation and its prompting technique. Extensive experiments with videos taken across several countries and cities, covering diverse urban scenarios, demonstrate the high scalability and generalizability of the proposed annotation method. Furthermore, performance analysis and real-world deployment for autonomous robot navigation showcase that

Autonomous Vehicle Navigation 2,Categorical Traffic Transformer: Interpretable and Diverse Behavior Prediction with Tokenized Latent,"Chen, Yuxiao;Tonkens, Sander;Pavone, Marco","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, AI-Based Methods, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: Adept traffic models are critical to both real-time prediction/planning and closed-loop simulation for autonomous vehicles (AV). Key design objectives include accuracy, diverse multimodal behaviors, interpretability, and compatibility with other modules in the autonomy stack, e.g., the downstream planner. We present Categorical Traffic Transformer (CTT), a traffic model that outputs both continuous trajectory predictions and categorical predictions with clear semantic meanings (lane modes, homotopies, etc.). The most outstanding feature of CTT is its fully interpretable latent space, which enables direct supervision of the latent variables from the ground truth during training and avoids mode collapse completely. As a result, CTT can generate diverse behaviors conditioned on different semantic modes while significantly beating SOTA on prediction accuracy. In addition, CTT's ability to input and output tokens enables direct integration with semantic-heavy modules such as behavior planners and language models, bridging the tokenized representation and the continuous trajectory space.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Navigation 2,LACNS: Language-Assisted Continuous Navigation in Structured Spaces,"Peng, RuTong;Zhang, Yiqing;Yang, Yi;Fu, Mengyin","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: Current autonomous driving technology typically relies on high-precision (HD) maps to ensure safe, reliable, and accurate navigation in urban environments. While these maps provide essential road information, their creation and maintenance are costly, limiting their widespread application. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a novel system, Language-Assisted Continuous Navigation in Structured Spaces (LACNS). LACNS facilitates autonomous driving without the need for HD maps by integrating vehicle-centric local perception with real-time language commands from map software or human navigators. LACNS begins by generating a BEV map using the vehicle's front-facing camera. Simultaneously, a pre-trained Visual Language Model (VLM) detects intersections from the camera images, assigning a score to each. Road elements are then extracted from the BEV map and combined with the intersection scores to identify potential navigation frontiers. Language instructions, processed by a pre-trained Large Language Model(LLM), are used to select the most suitable frontier. Finally, the chosen frontier and BEV map are employed to plan a safe route and control the vehicle's movement. We evaluated LACNS using the Carla simulator to validate its navigation capabilities in continuous spaces. Initial tests involved navigating through four intersections with varying directional commands, where LACNS demonstrated high and consistent success rates across multiple trials. Further simulations in real-time navigation scenarios revealed that LACNS consistently maintained a high success rate across three progressively challenging routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our novel HD map-independent autonomous driving navigation method.",,,,,,

An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior.

State-of-the-art exosuits typically use Bowden cable transmissions, albeit their limited efficiencies (40Â–60%) and non-linear response in curved paths. This paper evaluates the efficiency and responsiveness of a new cable-pulley transmission compared to a Bowden transmission, using both steel and Dyneema cables. The analysis includes three experiments: a test bench simulating a curved transmission path, followed by a static and dynamic experiment where six unimpaired participants donned an exosuit featuring both transmissions across the hips and knees. Our findings demonstrate that the pulley transmission consistently outperformed the BowdenÂ’s efficiency by absolute margins of 18.77 Â± 7.29% using a steel cable and by 40.60 Â± 6.76% using a Dyneema cable across all experiments. Additionally, the steel cable was on average 19.19 Â± 5.29% more efficient than the Dyneema cable in the pulley transmission and 41.02 Â± 6.34% in the Bowden tube. These results led to the development of the Stillsuit, a novel lower-limb cable-driven exosuit that uses a pulley transmission and steel cable.

However, personalizing the assistance often requires lengthy tuning procedures and computationally intensive algorithms, and most existing methods do not incorporate user feedback. In this work, we propose a novel approach for rapidly learning users' preferences for hip exoskeleton assistance. We perform pairwise comparisons of distinct randomly generated assistive profiles, and collect participants preferences through active querying. Users' feedback is integrated into a preference-learning algorithm that updates its belief, learns a user-dependent reward function, and changes the assistive torque profiles accordingly. Results from eight healthy subjects display distinct preferred torque profiles, and users' choices remain consistent when compared to a perturbed profile. A comprehensive evaluation of users' preferences reveals a close relationship with individual walking strategies. The tested torque profiles do not disrupt kinematic joint synergies, and participants favor assistive torques that are synchronized with their movements, resulting in lower negative power from the device. This straightforward approach enables the rapid learning of users preferences and rewards, grounding future studies on reward-based human-exoskeleton interaction.",,,,,,

SLAM 2,ISLAM: Imperative SLAM,"Fu, Taimeng;Su, Shaoshu;Lu, Yiren;Wang, Chen","Keywords: SLAM, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) stands as one of the critical challenges in robot navigation. A SLAM system often consists of a front-end component for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating estimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are highly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to be essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm between the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to sub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and generalization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel self-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM), which fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus enhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision. Specifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that the front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the front-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose graph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end component. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an application of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM training strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system showing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each other in a self-supervised manner.",,,,,,

Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.",,,,,,

Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally, effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing challenge. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a refined 3D Gaussian representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model.

While several methods for photorealistic scene representations, both implicitly using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and explicitly using 3DGS have shown promising results in scene reconstruction of relatively complex dynamic scenes, modeling the dynamic appearance of foreground objects tends to be challenging, limiting the applicability of these methods to capture subtleties and details of the scenes, especially for dynamic objects. To this end, we propose DENSER, a framework that significantly enhances the representation of dynamic objects and accurately models the appearance of dynamic objects in the driving scene.

To handle this, we introduce Fact-Hash, a novel parameter-encoding merging Tensor Factorization and Hash-encoding techniques. This integration offers two benefits: the use of rich high resolution features and the few-shot robustness. In Fact-Hash, we project 3D coordinates into multiple lower-dimensional forms (2D or 1D) before applying the hash function and then aggregate them into a single feature. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate Fact-Hash's superior memory efficiency, preserving quality and rendering speed. Fact-Hash saves memory usage by over one-third while maintaining the PSNR values compared to previous encoding methods. The on-device experiment validates the superiority of Fact-Hash compared to alternative positional encoding methods in computational efficiency and energy consumption. These findings highlight Fact-Hash as a promising solution to improve feature grid representation, address memory constraints, and improve quality in various applications.",,,,,,
3D Content Capture and Generation 2,3D Uncertain Implicit Surface Mapping Using GMM and GP,"Zou, Qianqian;Sester, Monika","Keywords: Mapping, Probability and Statistical Methods, Range Sensing","Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of constructing continuous three-dimensional (3D) models that accurately represent uncertain surfaces, derived from noisy and incomplete LiDAR scanning data. Building upon our prior work, which utilized the Gaussian Process (GP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for structured building models, we introduce a more generalized approach tailored for complex surfaces in urban scenes, where GMM Regression and GP with derivative observations are applied.
A Hierarchical GMM (HGMM) is employed to optimize the number of GMM components and speed up the GMM training. With the prior map obtained from HGMM, GP inference is followed for the refinement of the final map. Our approach models the implicit surface of the geo-object and enables the inference of the regions that are not completely covered by
measurements. The integration of GMM and GP yields well-calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside the surface model, enhancing both accuracy and reliability. The proposed method is evaluated on real data
collected by a mobile mapping system. Compared to the performance in mapping accuracy and uncertainty quantification of other methods, such as Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (GPIS) and log-Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (Log-GPIS), the proposed method achieves lower RMSEs, higher log-likelihood values and lower computational costs

Object Detection 1,Mono-Camera-Only Target Chasing for a Drone in a Dense Environment by Cross-Modal Learning,"Yoo, Seungyeon;Jung, Seungwoo;Lee, Yunwoo;Shim, Dongseok;Kim, H. Jin","Keywords: Visual Learning, Deep Learning Methods, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: Chasing a dynamic target in a dense environment is one of the challenging applications of autonomous drones. The task requires multi-modal data, such as RGB and depth, to accomplish safe and robust maneuver. However, using different types of modalities can be difficult due to the limited capacity of drones in aspects of hardware complexity and sensor cost. Our framework resolves such restrictions in the target chasing task by using only a monocular camera instead of multiple sensor inputs. From an RGB input, the perception module can extract a cross-modal representation containing information from multiple data modalities. To learn cross-modal representations at training time, we employ variational auto-encoder (VAE) structures and the joint objective function across heterogeneous data. Subsequently, using latent vectors acquired from the pre-trained perception module, the planning module generates a proper next-time-step waypoint by imitation learning of the expert, which performs a numerical optimization using the privileged RGB-D data. Furthermore, the planning module considers temporal information of the target to improve tracking performance through consecutive cross-modal representations. Ultimately, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through the reconstruction results of the perception module, the target chasing performance of the planning module, and the zero-shot sim-to-real deployment of a drone.",,,,,,

However, balancing perception performance and transmission costs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches that transmit region-level features across agents are limited in interpretability and demand substantial bandwidth, making them unsuitable for practical applications. In this work, we propose CoopDETR, a novel cooperative perception framework that introduces object-level feature cooperation via object query. Our framework consists of two key modules: single-agent query generation, which efficiently encodes raw sensor data into object queries, reducing transmission cost while preserving essential information for detection; and cross-agent query fusion, which includes Spatial Query Matching (SQM) and Object Query Aggregation (OQA) to enable effective interaction between queries. Our experiments on the OPV2V and V2XSet datasets demonstrate that CoopDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly reduces transmission costs to 1/782 of previous methods.",,,,,,
Object Detection 1,Learning Better Representations for Crowded Pedestrians in Offboard LiDAR-Camera 3D Tracking-By-Detection,"Li, Shichao;Li, Peiliang;Lian, Qing;Yun, Peng;Chen, Xiaozhi","Keywords: Computer Vision for Transportation, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Representation Learning","Abstract: Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency.

Object Detection 1,Bi-Stream Knowledge Transfer for Semi-Supervised 3D Point Cloud Object Detection,"Zheng, Jilai;Tang, Pin;Ren, Xiangxuan;Wang, Zhongdao;Ma, Chao","Keywords: Computer Vision for Transportation, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: 3D point cloud object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. However, labeling 3D object boxes is expensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of annotated point clouds used in fully-supervised training. This has led to a rise in semi-supervised 3D object detection research, which aims to improve model performance by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled point clouds. Existing methods typically rely on the Mean Teacher (MT) paradigm, which uses unlabeled instances discovered by the teacher with confidence scores higher than certain thresholds to train the student. However, this leads to a loss of information as it overlooks ambiguous instances from the teacher that could also contain valuable knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a Bi-Stream Knowledge Transfer (BiKT) framework that fully exploits and transfers knowledge from both confident and ambiguous instances to the student network. Specifically, all pseudo labels are allocated into two knowledge streams, the deterministic stream and the noisy stream, and then subsequently guide the student network through bi-level supervision. We also introduce a Dynamic Stream Switching (DSS) algorithm that sets the stream boundary tailored for the current learning status. To further improve the quality of pseudo labels in the knowledge streams, we propose a Diffusive Label Denoising (DLD) module, which is trained by explicitly generating noised instances and then learning to denoise them, as in diffusion models. Experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our BiKT on the ONCE validation and testing sets, as well as the robust generalization capability when confronted with diverse base detectors, increased amount of unlabeled data, and distinct datasets (e.g., Waymo), unveiling the power of semi-supervised learning in 3D object detection.",,,,,,

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.",,,,,,

Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

To address the challenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of thermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing fusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur due to the sensor configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of information in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called the Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate performance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when at least part of the scene is acquired by a single sensor. We propose an improved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor failure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also leverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in embedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial overlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our proposed method.

Many existing methods either assume simplified static environments or struggle to produce optimal solutions in real-time. In this work, we propose an efficient safe interval motion planning framework for navigation in dynamic environments. A safe interval refers to a time window during which a specific configuration is safe. Our approach addresses trajectory generation through a two-stage process: a front-end graph search step followed by a back-end gradient-based optimization. We ensure completeness and optimality by constructing a dynamic connected visibility graph and incorporating low-order dynamic bounds within safe intervals and temporal corridors. To avoid local minima, we propose a Uniform Temporal Visibility Deformation (UTVD) for the complete evaluation of spatial-temporal topological equivalence. We represent trajectories with B-Spline curves and apply gradient-based optimization to navigate around static and moving obstacles within spatial-temporal corridors. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that our method can achieve a success rate of over 95% in environments with different density levels, exceeding the performance of other approaches, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in highly dynamic environments.",,,,,,

Previous methods for motion planning in urban winds require global knowledge of the obstacles and flow field and do not lend themselves to real-time application. In this paper, a planning and control framework is proposed for safe and energy-efficient navigation through urban flow fields that strictly relies on onboard sensing. The algorithm incorporates predictions of local wind flow fields into a receding horizon optimal controller, balancing energy consumption with obstacle avoidance on the fly to reach a goal destination. Simulation studies on a procedurally generated urban map with diverse wind conditions demonstrate that the energy-aware motion planner reduces energy consumption by as much as 30% and results in 32% fewer crashes on average compared to the wind-agnostic baseline. Comparisons to a global wind-aware planner indicate only minor trade-offs associated with planning on a local horizon.",,,,,,

However, most existing methods only achieve safe navigation in static environments or spacious scenes with few moving obstacles. Motivated by this open problem, this paper presents a complete system for safe and autonomous UAVs flights in unknown clustered environments with multiple dynamic obstacles. To properly represent complex dynamic environments, we develop a 3D dynamic Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) mapping method that initially segments and tracks dynamic obstacles using a novel feature-based association strategy, while fusing the remaining static obstacles into ESDF map. Then, we propose a joint trajectory planning and motion control framework for safely avoiding surrounding obstacles. Specifically, the gradient-based B-spline trajectory optimization algorithm is employed to generate a collision-free static trajectory with respect to static obstacles. To avoid dynamic obstacles while adaptively tracking the static trajectory, we utilize time-adaptive model predictive control combined with Dynamic Control Barrier Function (D-CBF), which maps the collision avoidance constraints of dynamic obstacles onto the control inputs. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments confirm that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches for UAVs flights in challenging dynamic environments.",,,,,,

The problem requires finding time-optimal trajectories that conform to system dynamics, meeting computational constraints for real-time adaptation, and accounting for uncertainty from environmental changes. To address these challenges, we propose a sampling-based online planning algorithm that leverages neural network inference to replace time-consuming nonlinear trajectory optimization, enabling rapid exploration of multiple trajectory options under uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to the drone interception problem, where a defense drone must intercept a target while avoiding collisions and handling imperfect target predictions. The algorithm efficiently generates trajectories toward multiple potential target drone positions in parallel. It then assesses trajectory reachability by comparing traversal times with the target drone's predicted arrival time, ultimately selecting the minimum-time reachable trajectory. Through extensive validation in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate our method's capability for high-rate online planning and its adaptability to unpredictable movements in unstructured settings.",,,,,,

Aerial Robots: Trajectory Planning and Control,Servo Integrated Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Overactuated Tiltable-Quadrotors,"Li, Jinjie;Sugihara, Junichiro;Zhao, Moju","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Motion Control","Abstract: Utilizing a servo to tilt each rotor transforms quadrotors from underactuated to overactuated systems, allowing for independent control of both attitude and position, which provides advantages for aerial manipulation. However, this enhancement also introduces model nonlinearity, sluggish servo response, and limited operational range into the system, posing challenges to dynamic control. In this study, we propose a control approach for tiltable-quadrotors based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). Unlike conventional cascade methods, our approach preserves the full dynamics without simplification. It directly uses rotor thrust and servo angle as control inputs, where their limited working ranges are considered input constraints. Notably, we incorporate a first-order servo model within the NMPC framework. Simulation reveals that integrating the servo dynamics is not only an enhancement to control performance but also a critical factor for optimization convergence. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we fabricate a tiltable-quadrotor and deploy the algorithm onboard at 100Hz.

Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.",,,,,,

Zippy has rounded feet, a single motor without feedback control, and is capable of turning, skipping, and ascending steps. At its fastest pace, the robot achieves a forward walking speed of 25 cm/s, which is 10 leg lengths per second, the fastest biped robot of any size by that metric. This work explores the design and performance of the robot and compares it to similar dynamic walking robots at larger scales.",,,,,,
Legged Locomotion: Novel Platforms,Exploration and Analysis of Torso-Limb Coordination of Quadruped Walkers with Compliant Torso,"Xiang, Yuxuan;Sedoguchi, Taiki;Zheng, Yanqiu;Asano, Fumihiko","Keywords: Legged Robots, Underactuated Robots","Abstract: Quadrupeds exhibit remarkable locomotion performance through the coordination between their limbs and torso. From past biological knowledge, it is understood that during walking, the forelimbs primarily contribute to braking, while the hindlimb are responsible for propulsion. However, in the field of quadruped robot dynamics, effectively leveraging this coordination remains a challenge. To investigate the torso-limb coordination, this study explores the walking performance of a quadruped walker with a compliant torso, driven by the forelimb or the hindlimb. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the walking behavior under different control drive methods. The findings provide insights into the design of compliant-bodied robots and the optimal distribution of propulsion forces between the forelimbs and hindlimbs.",,,,,,
Legged Locomotion: Novel Platforms,Effective Self-Righting Strategies for Elongate Multi-Legged Robots,"Teder, Erik;Chong, Baxi;He, Juntao;Wang, Tianyu;Iaschi, Massimiliano;Soto, Daniel;Goldman, Daniel","Keywords: Legged Robots, Field Robots, Multi-Contact Whole-Body Motion Planning and Control","Abstract: Centipede-like robots offer an effective and robust solution to navigation over complex terrain with minimal sensing. However, when climbing over obstacles, such multi-legged robots often elevate their center-of-mass into unstable configurations, where even moderate terrain uncertainty can cause tipping over. Robust mechanisms for such elongate multi-legged robots to self-right remain unstudied. Here, we developed a comparative biological and robophysical approach to investigate self-righting strategies. We first released textit{S. polymorpha} upside down from a 10 cm height and recorded their self-righting behaviors using top and side view high-speed cameras. Using kinematic analysis, we hypothesize that these behaviors can be prescribed by two traveling waves superimposed in the bodyÂ’s lateral and vertical planes, respectively. We tested our hypothesis on an elongate robot with static (non-actuated) limbs, and we successfully reconstructed these self-righting behaviors. We further evaluated how wave parameters affect self-righting effectiveness. We identified two key wave parameters: the spatial frequency, which characterizes the sequence of body-rolling, and the wave amplitude, which characterizes body curvature. By empirically obtaining a behavior diagram of spatial frequency and amplitude, we identify effective and versatile self-righting strategies for general elongate multi-legged robots, which greatly enhances these robots' mobility and robustness in practical applications such as agricultural terrain inspection and search-and-rescue.",,,,,,
Legged Locomotion: Novel Platforms,Addition of a Peristaltic Wave Improves Multi-Legged Locomotion Performance on Complex Terrains,"Iaschi, Massimiliano;Chong, Baxi;Wang, Tianyu;Lin, Jianfeng;Xu, Zhaochen;Soto, Daniel;He, Juntao;Goldman, Daniel","Keywords: Legged Robots, Search and Rescue Robots, Biologically-Inspired Robots","Abstract: Characterized by their elongate bodies and relatively simple legs, multi-legged robots have the potential to locomote through complex terrains for applications such as search-and-rescue and terrain inspection. Prior work has developed effective and reliable locomotion strategies for multi-legged robots by propagating the two waves of lateral body undulation and leg stepping, which we will refer to as the two-wave template. However, these robots have limited capability to climb over obstacles with sizes comparable to their heights. We hypothesize that such limitations stem from the two-wave template that we used to prescribe the multi-legged locomotion. Seeking effective alternative waves for obstacle-climbing, we designed a five-segment robot with static (non-actuated) legs, where each cable-driven joint has a rotational degree-of-freedom (DoF) in the sagittal plane (vertical wave) and a linear DoF (peristaltic wave). We tested robot locomotion performance on a flat terrain and a rugose terrain. While the benefit of peristalsis on flat-ground locomotion is marginal, the inclusion of a peristaltic wave substantially improves the locomotion performance in rugose terrains: it not only enables obstacle-climbing capabilities with obstacles having a similar height as the robot, but it also significantly improves the traversing capabilities of the robot in such terrains. Our results demonstrate an alternative actuation mechanism for multi-legged robots, paving the way towards all-terrain multi-legged robots.",,,,,,

Ali","Keywords: Medical Robots and Systems, Surgical Robotics: Planning","Abstract: Several robotic frameworks have been recently developed to assist ophthalmic surgeons in performing complex vitreoretinal procedures such as subretinal injection of advanced therapeutics. These surgical robots show promising capabilities; however, most of them have to limit their working volume to achieve maximum accuracy. Moreover, the visible area seen through the surgical microscope is limited and solely depends on the eye posture. If the eye posture, trocar position, and robot configuration are not correctly arranged, the instrument may not reach the target position, and the preparation will have to be redone. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimization framework of the eye tilting and the robot positioning to reach various target areas for different patients. Our method was validated with an adjustable phantom eye model, and the error of this workflow was 0.13 Â± 1.65 deg (rotational joint around Y axis), -1.40 Â± 1.13 deg (around X axis), and 1.80 Â± 1.51 mm (depth, Z).

A major challenge in automating surgical procedures like suturing is accurately modeling the suture thread, a highly flexible and compliant component. Existing models either lack the accuracy needed for safety-critical procedures or are too computationally intensive for real-time execution. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for modeling suture thread dynamics using control barrier functions (CBFs), achieving both realism and computational efficiency. Thread-like behavior, collision avoidance, stiffness, and damping are all modeled within a unified CBF and control Lyapunov function (CLFs) framework. Our approach eliminates the need to calculate complex forces or solve differential equations, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining a realistic model suitable for both automation and virtual-reality surgical training systems. The framework also allows visual cues to be provided based on the threadÂ’s interaction with the environment, enhancing user experience when performing suture or ligation tasks. The proposed model is tested on the MagnetoSuture system, a minimally invasive robotic surgical platform that uses magnetic fields to manipulate suture needles, offering a less invasive solution for surgical procedures.",,,,,,

The simulation is specifically developed for robotic colonoscopy devices inside the human colon. A virtual simulation of the locomotion mechanism of a prototype robotic colonoscope and the colon was created in Ansys, and robot/colon experiments were conducted on different colon surfaces to validate simulation results. The successfully simulated propulsion force generated by the prototype produced an RMSE of 7% when compared at the optimal operating condition of the device, and 25-30% when compared to a full range of device velocities. The larger RMSE is due to physical phenomena that were not present in the simulation due to the constraints applied. The simulation, however, allowed evaluation of difficult quantities to measure in the real settings such as the normal interaction force between the device and tissue wall, and stress distribution across the locomotion mechanism, as well as a phenomenon of oscillating propulsion force resulting from the device design. This work demonstrates feasibility of using finite element simulation to shape the design and optimization of a robotic colonoscope, and understands its interaction with highly complex human anatomy.",,,,,,

Despite advancements in screening and treatment, there remains a critical need for more effective and minimally invasive methods to manage complex polyps and early-stage colorectal cancers. This study introduces a novel approach to magnetic tissue manipulation for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD), leveraging visual feedback to enhance precision and control. We develop and evaluate the proposed system within a ROS Gazebo simulation environment, integrating a small magnetic endoscopic clip affixed to tissue, which is manipulated by an external large magnet mounted on a robotic arm.
A key challenge in ESD is achieving adequate tissue exposure for precise cutting, particularly in the confined space of the colon where the endoscope is manually controlled. To address this, our system enables controlled manipulation of the magnetic clip to optimize tissue retraction. The robotic arm, guided by real-time visual feedback, dynamically adjusts the internal clipÂ’s orientation. Multiple virtual cameras were used to validate the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrated that the robot arm successfully manipulated the internal magnetic clip to the desired tilt angle within an average of 8.4 seconds (range 5.3 to 15.2 s).

By collecting data regarding the state of a robot in a variety of configurations, neural networks can be trained to predict this interaction force. This paper extends existing work in this domain based on collecting one of the largest known ground truth force datasets for stationary as well as moving phantoms that replicate tissue motions found in clinical procedures. Existing methods, and a new transformer-based architecture, are evaluated to demonstrate the domain gap between stationary and moving phantom tissue data and the impact that data scaling has on each architecture's ability to generalize the force estimation task. It was found that temporal networks were more sensitive to the moving domain than single-sample Feed Forward Networks (FFNs) that were trained on stationary tissue data. However, the transformer approach results in the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when evaluating networks trained on examples of both stationary and moving phantom tissue samples. The results demonstrate the domain gap between stationary and moving surgical environments and the effectiveness of scaling datasets for increased accuracy of interaction force prediction.",,,,,,

Current techniques rely on palpating cartilage landmarks, which can be imprecise. This paper presents RASEC, an autonomous palpation-based strategy that enhances robot-assisted tracheotomy by interactively predicting acquisition points to maximize information and minimize palpation costs. We employ a Gaussian Process (GP) to model the distribution of tissue hardness, integrating anatomical data as prior input to guide palpation. A dynamic tactile sensor, based on resonant frequency, measures tissue hardness with millimeter-scale contact for secure interaction. We use kernel fusion, combining the Squared Exponential (SE) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) kernels, to optimize Bayesian searches using laryngeal anatomical knowledge. The acquisition strategy also considers the tactile sensorÂ’s movement distance and the robotic base link's rotation during incision localization. Simulations and physical experiments demonstrate a 53.1% reduction in sensor movement distance and a 75.2% improvement in rotation angle.

To ensure the consistency between the local and global paths, we introduce the concept of locally homotopic paths for paths with different origins and destinations. We then formulate a hard constraint to ensure that local paths are locally homotopic to a given global path. Additionally, we propose a cost function to penalize any violation of this requirement rather than completely prohibiting it. Experimental results show that both variants of our approach are more resilient to localization errors compared to existing methods that represent the homotopy class constraint as an envelope around the global path.",,,,,,

Each target moves with a constant velocity within its time windows, and the agent has a speed limit no smaller than any target's speed. We present FMC*-TSP, the first complete and bounded-suboptimal algorithm for the MT-TSP-O, and results for an agent whose configuration space is in R^3. Our algorithm interleaves a high-level search and a low-level search where the high-level search solves a generalized traveling salesman problem with time windows (GTSP-TW) to find a sequence of targets and corresponding time windows for the agent to visit. Given such a sequence, the low-level search then finds an associated agent trajectory. To solve the low-level planning problem, we develop a new algorithm called FMC*, which finds a shortest path on a graph of convex sets (GCS) via implicit graph search and pruning techniques specialized for problems with moving targets. We test FMC*-TSP on 280 problem instances with up to 40 targets and demonstrate its smaller median runtime than a baseline based on prior work.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 3,Adaptive Distance Functions Via Kelvin Transformation,"Cabral Muchacho, Rafael Ignacio;Pokorny, Florian T.","Keywords: Computational Geometry, Robot Safety","Abstract: The term safety in robotics is often understood as a synonym for avoidance. Although this perspective has led to progress in path planning and reactive control, a generalization of this perspective is necessary to include task semantics relevant to contact-rich manipulation tasks, especially during teleoperation and to ensure the safety of learned policies. We introduce the semantics-aware distance function and a corresponding computational method based on the Kelvin Transformation. This allows us to compute smooth distance approximations in an unbounded domain by instead solving a Laplace equation in a bounded domain. The semantics-aware distance generalizes signed distance functions by allowing the zero level set to lie inside of the object in regions where contact is allowed, effectively incorporating task semantics, such as object affordances, in an adaptive implicit representation of safe sets. In numerical experiments we show the computational viability of our method for real applications and visualize the computed function on a wrench with various semantic regions.",,,,,,

However, these mechanisms require robots to explicitly obtain the velocity of their neighbors as the sensory input to make motion decisions. This further poses great challenges in real-world applications of swarm robotics. In this letter, inspired by the chasing behavior in large-scale migrating locusts, we propose a visual attention-based model to achieve collective behaviors with positional interaction. Through numerical simulations, we find the emergence of three typical collective behaviors: flocking, milling and swarming. To gain deep insights into the new proposed model, we investigate the impact of group size and sensory blindness on the emergence of collective behaviors. Moreover, by using the mean field analysis framework, we present the theoretical proof of the emergence of flocking and milling behavior. Furthermore, to validate the feasibility of our proposed model, we reproduce the flocking and milling behavior with up to 50 physical robots.

Multi-Robot Swarms 2,Impossibility of Self-Organized Aggregation without Computation,"Steinberg, Roy;Solovey, Kiril","Keywords: Swarm Robotics, Multi-Robot Systems, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents","Abstract: In their seminal work, Gauci et al. (2014) studied the fundamental task of aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori agreed-upon meeting location, using extremely limited hardware. That paper considered differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover, the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether there exists a controller that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation proof of the aforementioned paper for two robots and present an alternative controller alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Swarms 2,Learning Adversarial Policies for Swarm Leader Identification Using a Probing Agent,"Bachoumas, Stergios;Artemiadis, Panagiotis",Keywords: Swarm Robotics,"Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to swarm leader identification (SLI) in multi-agent robot systems by employing a physical adversary interacting with the swarm in the same environment. We develop a new simulation environment to study the SLI problem and train an adversary, which we term the prober, to solve the SLI problem using forceful interactions with the swarm as its guiding information source. The prober's policy is modeled using the simplified structure state space sequence (S5) model and trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The prober only has access to the information on the relative positions of the other agents. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations using two performance metrics and validate the sim-to-real transfer through robot experiments. Results on evaluating the performance in 10,000 different testing scenarios demonstrate that our method finds the leader's identity in the vast majority (95.7%) of the cases, regardless of the initial leader selection during training.

This work presents a novel approach for such systems, leveraging long-horizon action anticipation from short-observation contexts. In an assistive cooking task, we demonstrate that predicting human intention leads to effective collaboration between humans and robots. Compared to prior approaches, our method halves the required observation time of human behavior before accurate future predictions can be made, thus, allowing for quick and effective task support from short contexts. To provide sufficient context in such scenarios, our proposed method analyzes the human user and their interaction with surrounding scene objects by imbuing the system with additional domain knowledge, encoding the scene object's affordances. We integrate this knowledge into a transformer-based action anticipation architecture, which alters the attention mechanism between different visual features by either boosting or attenuating the attention between them. Through this approach, we achieve an up to 9% improvement on two common action anticipation benchmarks, namely 50Salads and Breakfast.

Human-Robot Collaboration 1,Evaluating Robotic Performative Autonomy in Collaborative Contexts Impacted by Latency,"Sousa Silva, Rafael;Smith, Cailyn;Ferreira Bezerra, Lara;Williams, Tom","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Space Robotics and Automation, Human-Centered Automation","Abstract: Maintaining Situational Awareness (SA) is critical in space exploration contexts, yet made particularly difficult due to the presence of communication latency. In order to increase human SA without inducing cognitive overload, researchers have proposed Performative Autonomy (PA), in which robots intentionally interact at a lower level of autonomy than they are capable of. While researchers have demonstrated positive impacts of PA on team performance even under high latency, previous work on PA has not examined how the benefits of PA might be mediated by latency. In this work, we thus evaluate the impact of latency and PA on trust, SA, and human perceptions of robot intelligence and autonomy. Our results suggest that lower performed autonomy leads to increased cognitive load, especially when robot communication happens frequently and latency is present. In addition, we observe no effect of the PA strategies used within our experimental paradigm on SA, and instead find evidence that operating under high latency leads to negative perceptions of robots regardless of choice of PA strategy.",,,,,,

However, existing LLM-based systems often overlook the misalignment between human and robot perceptions, which hinders their effective communication and real-world robot deployment. To address this issue, we introduce SYNERGAI, a unified system designed to achieve both perceptual alignment and human-robot collaboration. At its core, SYNERGAI employs 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) as its explicit and innate representation. This enables the system to leverage LLM to break down complex tasks and allocate appropriate tools in intermediate steps to extract relevant information from the 3DSG, modify its structure, or generate responses. Importantly, SYNERGAI incorporates an automatic mechanism that enables perceptual misalignment correction with users by updating its 3DSG in real-time. In a zero-shot manner, SYNERGAI achieves comparable performance with the data-driven models in ScanQA. Through comprehensive experiments across 10 real-world scenes, SYNERGAI demonstrates its effectiveness in establishing common ground with humans, realizing a success rate of 61.9% in alignment tasks.

Human-Robot Collaboration 1,Context-Aware Collaborative Pushing of Heavy Objects Using Skeleton-Based Intention Prediction,"Solak, Gokhan;Giardini Lahr, Gustavo Jose;Ozdamar, Idil;Ajoudani, Arash","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Intention Recognition, Physical Human-Robot Interaction","Abstract: In physical human-robot interaction, force feedback has been the most common sensing modality to convey the human intention to the robot. It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatio-temporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency.",,,,,,
Human-Robot Collaboration 1,Interactive Distance Field Mapping and Planning to Enable Human-Robot Collaboration,"Ali, Usama;Wu, Lan;Mueller, Adrian;Sukkar, Fouad;Kaupp, Tobias;Vidal-Calleja, Teresa A.","Keywords: Mapping, Human-Robot Collaboration","Abstract: Human-robot collaborative applications require scene representations that are kept up-to-date and facilitate safe motions in dynamic scenes. In this letter, we present an interactive distance field mapping and planning (IDMP) framework that handles dynamic objects and collision avoidance through an efficient representation. We define interactive mapping and planning as the process of creating and updating the representation of the scene online while simultaneously planning and adapting the robot's actions based on that representation. The key aspect of this work is an efficient Gaussian Process field that performs incremental updates and handles dynamic objects reliably by identifying moving points via a simple and elegant formulation based on queries from a temporary latent model. In terms of mapping, IDMP is able to fuse point cloud data from single and multiple sensors, query the free space at any spatial resolution, and deal with moving objects without semantics. In terms of planning, IDMP allows seamless integration with gradient-based reactive planners facilitating dynamic obstacle avoidance for safe human-robot interactions. Our mapping performance is evaluated on both real and synthetic datasets. A comparison with similar state-of-the-art frameworks shows superior performance when handling dynamic objects and comparable or better performance in the accuracy of the computed distance and gradient field. Finally, we show how the framework can be used for fast motion planning in the presence of moving objects both in simulated and real-world scenes.

By using single-precision numbers within the filter, we significantly reduce computational load and memory requirements. In addition, we employ a fast Mahalanobis distance test and block Householder triangulation to accelerate the calculations. To mitigate feature drift from frame-to-frame optical flow, we create keyframes at regular intervals and refine long-tracked features between them.

The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 mÂ². With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short. We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.",,,,,,

An ideal solution entails capturing precise state measurements for decisions and controls, which is considerably difficult, especially in increasingly unstructured outdoor regimes of operations for these robots. In this milieu, a framework to identify pre-determined discrete modes of operation can considerably simplify the motion model identification process.

However, precise calibration of the time offset between these two sensor types is a prerequisite for accurate and robust tracking. To address this, we propose a universal online temporal calibration strategy for optimization-based visual-inertial navigation systems. Technically, we incorporate the time offset as a state parameter in the optimization residual model to align the IMU state to the corresponding image timestamp using time offset, angular velocity and translational velocity. This allows the temporal misalignment to be optimized alongside other tracking states during the process. As our method only modifies the structure of the residual model, it can be applied to various optimization-based frameworks with different tracking frontends. We evaluate our calibration method with both EuRoC and simulation data and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate time offset estimation and faster convergence, particularly in the presence of noisy sensor data.The experimental code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/Ts_Online_Optimization.",,,,,,

Tracking and Prediction 2,LMH-MOT : A Light Multiple Hypothesis Framework for 3D Multi-Object Tracking,"Yuan, Tanghu;Yang, Mengxiang",Keywords: Visual Tracking,"Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) is a key area in the field of autonomous driving. In systems that track by detection, the detection results of deep learning models will inevitably have FP(False Positives) and FN(False Nagatives), and detector always cannot continuously and accurately detect targets when facing obstacle occlusion and sensor blind spots. The task of 3D-MOT is to combine the discrete and disordered target detection results in time sequence into continuous and reliable tracks for use by downstream planning modules. At present, multi-target tracking algorithms in the field of autonomous driving are all based on single-hypothesis. In crowded scenarios, both false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) significantly increase, making it difficult for single-hypothesis-based tracking algorithms to accurately output tracks. Towards this end, we propose LMH-MOT, a light multiple hypothesis framework for 3D MOT. Specifically, LMH-MOT effectively handles complex data association problems in autonomous driving scenarios by generating and maintaining multiple sets of hypotheses. Recognizing the possibility of switching between different motion states of the object, we use multiple motion models to more accurately estimate the motion state of the same object at the same time, and select the best estimation result for output. Additionally, we introduce a data association method based on decision trees, making full use of various features of the track and greatly reducing false matches and missing matches.

Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.",,,,,,
Robot Mapping 2,SMART: Advancing Scalable Map Priors for Driving Topology Reasoning,"Ye, Junjie;Paz, David;Zhang, Hengyuan;Guo, Yuliang;Huang, Xinyu;Christensen, Henrik Iskov;Wang, Yue;Ren, Liu","Keywords: Mapping, Computer Vision for Transportation","Abstract: Topology reasoning is crucial for autonomous driving as it enables comprehensive understanding of connectivity and relationships between lanes and traffic elements. While recent approaches have shown success in perceiving driving topology using vehicle-mounted sensors, their scalability is hindered by the reliance on training data captured by consistent sensor configurations. We identify that the key factor in scalable lane perception and topology reasoning is the elimination of this sensor-dependent feature. To address this, we propose SMART, a scalable solution that leverages easily available standard-definition (SD) and satellite maps to learn a map prior model, supervised by large-scale geo-referenced high-definition (HD) maps independent of sensor settings. Attributing to scaled training, SMART alone achieves superior offline lane topology understanding using only SD and satellite inputs. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that SMART can be seamlessly integrated into any online topology reasoning method, yielding significant improvements by up to 28% on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark.

Robot Mapping 2,Ephemerality Meets LiDAR-Based Lifelong Mapping,"Gil, Hyeonjae;Lee, Dongjae;Kim, Giseop;Kim, Ayoung","Keywords: Mapping, SLAM, Range Sensing","Abstract: Lifelong mapping is crucial for the long-term deployment of robots in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present ELite, an ephemerality-aided LiDAR-based lifelong mapping framework which can seamlessly align multiple session data, remove dynamic objects, and update maps in an end-to-end fashion. Map elements are typically classified as static or dynamic, but cases like parked cars indicate the need for more detailed categories than binary. Central to our approach is the probabilistic modeling of the world into two-stage ephemerality, which represent the transiency of points in the map within two different time scales. By leveraging the spatiotemporal context encoded in ephemeralities, ELite can accurately infer transient map elements, maintain a reliable up-to-date static map, and improve robustness in aligning the new data in a more fine-grained manner. Extensive real-world experiments on long-term datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system.

Robot Mapping 2,Addressing Diverging Training Costs Using BEVRestore for High-Resolution Bird's Eye View Map Construction,"Kim, Minsu;Kim, Giseop;Choi, Sunwook","Keywords: Sensor Fusion, Mapping, Range Sensing","Abstract: Recent advancements in BirdÂ’s Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky motion planning like collision avoidance, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel BEVRestore mechanism. Specifically, our proposed model encodes the features of each sensor to LR BEV space and restores them to HR space to establish a memory-efficient map constructor. To this end, we introduce the BEV restoration strategy, which restores aliasing, and blocky artifacts of the up- scaled BEV features, and narrows down the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed mechanism provides a plug-and-play, memory-efficient pipeline, enabling an HR map construction with a broad BEV scope.

Although various light-weight strategies are adopted, directly designing the compact network can be sub-optimal and difficult to strike the balance between accuracy and model size. To solve this problem, we explore a more efficient grasp detection model from two aspects: elaborately designing a light-weight network and performing knowledge distillation on the designed network. Specifically, based on the designed light-weight backbone, the features from RGB and D images with unequal effective grasping information rates are fully utilized and the information compensation strategies are adopted to make the model small enough while maintaining its accuracy. Then, the grasping features contained in the large teacher model are adaptively and effectively learned by our proposed method via knowledge distillation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to achieve comparable performance (98.9%, 93.1%, 82.3%, and 90.0% on Cornell, Jacquard, GraspNet, and MultiObj datasets respectively) with more complicate models while reducing the parameters from MBs to KBs.

Manipulation 3,ViViDex: Learning Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation from Human Videos,"Chen, Zerui;Chen, Shizhe;Arlaud, Etienne;Laptev, Ivan;Schmid, Cordelia","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Learning from Demonstration, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: In this work, we aim to learn a unified vision-based policy for multi-fingered robot hands to manipulate a variety of objects in diverse poses. Though prior work has shown benefits of using human videos for policy learning, performance gains have been limited by the noise in estimated trajectories. Moreover, reliance on privileged object information such as ground-truth object states further limits the applicability in realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework ViViDex to improve vision-based policy learning from human videos. It first uses reinforcement learning with trajectory guided rewards to train state-based policies for each video, obtaining both visually natural and physically plausible trajectories from the video. We then rollout successful episodes from state-based policies and train a unified visual policy without using any privileged information. We propose coordinate transformation to further enhance the visual point cloud representation, and compare behavior cloning and diffusion policy for the visual policy training. Experiments both in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate that ViViDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three dexterous manipulation tasks.",,,,,,
Manipulation 3,HuDOR: Bridging the Human to Robot Dexterity Gap through Object-Oriented Rewards,"Guzey, Irmak;Dai, Yinlong;Savva, Georgy;Bhirangi, Raunaq Mahesh;Pinto, Lerrel","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Training robots directly from human videos is an emerging area in robotics and computer vision. While there has been notable progress with two-fingered grippers, learning autonomous tasks without teleoperation remains a difficult problem for multi-fingered robot hands. A key reason for this difficulty is that a policy trained on human hands may not directly transfer to a robot hand with a different morphology. In this work, we present HuDOR, a technique that enables online finetuning of the policy by constructing a reward function from the human video. Importantly, this reward function is built using object-oriented rewards derived from off-the-shelf point trackers, which allows for meaningful learning signals even when the robot hand is in the visual observation, while the human hand is used to construct the reward. Given a single video of human solving a task, such as gently opening a music box, HuDOR allows our four-fingered Allegro hand to learn this task with just 30 minutes of online interaction. Our experiments across four tasks, show that HuDOR outperforms alternatives with an average of 4x improvement.

We build a framework to use in-the-wild videos to generate sensorimotor robot trajectories. We do so by lifting both the human hand and the manipulated object in a shared 3D space and retargeting human motions to robot actions. Generative modeling on this data gives us a task-agnostic base policy. This policy captures a general yet flexible manipulation prior. We empirically demonstrate that finetuning this policy, with both reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC), enables sample-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks and simultaneously improves robustness and generalizability compared to alternate approaches.",,,,,,
Manipulation 3,SuperQ-GRASP: Superquadrics-Based Grasp Pose Estimation on Larger Objects for Mobile-Manipulation,"Tu, Xun;Desingh, Karthik","Keywords: Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Grasping, RGB-D Perception","Abstract: Grasp planning and estimation have been a long-standing research problem in robotics, with two main approaches to find graspable poses on the objects: 1) geometric approach, which relies on 3D models of objects and the gripper to estimate valid grasp poses, and 2) data-driven, learning-based approach, with models trained to identify grasp poses from raw sensor observations. The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations.
In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation.
We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) - parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size.

To address these challenges, this study explores several hybrid approaches that combine analytical models with neural networks to model PAM behavior more effectively. The results demonstrate that hybrid models significantly outperform both purely analytical and black-box neural network models, particularly in terms of generalization and dynamic accuracy.

The thin McKibben muscle, which has a small diameter, has the advantage of a high force-to-mass ratio and sufficient flexibility for use in a bent state. This flexibility permits the realization of flexible mechatronics. However, the thin McKibben muscle is easily broken in a bent state while it is very durable in a straight state. Over repetitive operations, the fibers within the sleeve gradually shift, causing the rubber tube inside to protrude and ultimately leading to cracking. This study investigates improvements in the durability of artificial muscles using adhesives to prevent this fiber-to-fiber misalignment. The durability test showed that the adhesive could provide a durability of up to 10,000-times greater than that of a normal artificial muscle in the maximum case. Using the thin McKibben muscle with the proposed method, tensegrity modules were fabricated. The durability test revealed a 500-fold increase under an applied pressure of 0.5 MPa.

Distinguished with previous methods that rely on complete observations, we explore a new map construction problem under incomplete observations where one or more perspectives of the surround-view are missing due to camera damage or occlusion. Incomplete observations lead to inferior performance and may even result in failure. Map construction based on incomplete observations faces two challenges: supplementing missing perspective features and reducing the complexity of high-dimensional feature learning. To address these issues, we propose a novel Panoramic Observation Prior Network (POP-Net). Firstly, based on the observation switch training mechanism, we propose a Panoramic Learning Module (PL-Module). It establishes a learnable panoramic feature space, facilitating the extraction of panoramic features from incomplete observations, thus supplementing missing perspective features. Secondly, based on the feature decomposition mechanism, we design a Panoramic Decomposition-Aggregation Operation (PDA-Operation), which decomposes high-dimensional panoramic features into low-dimensional local scene features. This allows limited local scene features to represent diverse panoramic features, alleviating computational and memory burdens of high-dimensional feature learning.

A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also go- ing beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose to treat each single trajectory predictor as an Â“expertÂ” and maintain a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data Â–the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next time stepÂ– to form a convex-or- nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts.

However, conventional tractor-driven articulated wheeled robots exhibit poor internal stability and are prone to jackknifing, while also consuming a significant amount of energy. By deploying distributed drives and coordinating control among multiple drives, these issues can be effectively addressed. However, the flexible connections between the bodies of articulated vehicles pose significant challenges to the coordinated control of distributed drives. This paper proposes a multi-drive unit coordinated control algorithm based on driving force equivalence and allocation. A neural network is used to predict the driving force, and through nonlinear driving force equivalence, a feedforward driving force is obtained. This is combined with a closed-loop feedback compensation controller to form a control architecture that integrates feedforward and feedback, resulting in the equivalent total driving force for the vehicle queue. Subsequently, an equivalent distribution strategy allocates the required driving force to each drive, enabling the vehicle bodies to achieve accurate and stable speed tracking while allowing each drive to operate near its efficient operating point, thereby reducing total energy consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly lowers the total energy consumption of the vehicle queue under standard operating conditions while ensuring speed-tracking accuracy and improving internal stability.",,,,,,

While guided meta reinforcement learning (RL) approach that first trains a guiding policy to train the ego agent has proven effective in improving generalizability across scenarios with various levels of interaction, the state-of-the-art method tends to be overly sensitive to extreme cases, impairing the agents' performance in the more common scenarios. This study introduces a novel training framework that integrates guided meta RL with importance sampling (IS) to optimize training distributions iteratively for navigating highly interactive driving scenarios, such as T-intersections or roundabouts. Unlike traditional methods that may underrepresent critical interactions or overemphasize extreme cases during training, our approach strategically adjusts the training distribution towards more challenging driving behaviors using IS proposal distributions and applies the importance ratio to de-bias the result. By estimating a naturalistic distribution from real-world datasets and employing a mixture model for iterative training refinements, the framework ensures a balanced focus across common and extreme driving scenarios. Experiments conducted with both synthetic and naturalistic datasets demonstrate both accelerated training and performance improvements under highly interactive driving tasks.",,,,,,

Manually steering the guidewire is challenging due to the lack of direct tip control and the high tortuosity of vessel structures, potentially resulting in vessel perforation or guidewire fracture. These challenges can be alleviated through the use of robotically steerable guidewires that can improve guidewire tip control, provide force feedback, and, similar to commercial guidewires, are inherently safe due to their compliant structure. However, robotic guidewires are not yet clinically viable due to small robot lengths or large actuation systems. In this paper, we develop a highly compact spooling mechanism for the COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot, capable of dispensing a clinically viable length of 1.5 m of the robotic guidewire. The mechanism utilizes a spool with several interior armatures to actuate each component of the COAST guidewire. The kinematics of the robotic guidewire are then modeled considering additional friction forces caused by interactions within the mechanism. The actuating mechanisms of the compact spooling mechanism are calibrated and the kinematics of the guidewire are validated resulting in an average curvature RMSE of 0.24 mâˆ?.",,,,,,

Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from insufficient printing precision and/or lack of quantitative analysis of the thickness and uniformity of bioprinted constructs (BPCs) - which are critical for ensuring cell viability and growth. To address these limitations, in this study, we present a framework for robotic bioprinting and complementary vision-based algorithms to quantitatively analyze thickness and uniformity of BPCs with curved geometries.

It provides detailed cardiac imaging by inserting a probe into the esophagus, which offers an unobstructed view of the heartÂ’s chambers and valves. Addressing the operational challenges and health risks of the sonographer associated with the manual procedure, a novel robotic TEE system is developed to teleoperate the TEE probe across all four degrees of freedom (4-DoFs). This actuation device features an easily assembled design for post-operative cleaning and sanitization. Moreover, this system enhances the precision of tip bending angles through an optimization technique for offline calibration of the actuation plane. The hysteresis effect inherent in the tendon-driven mechanism is characterized and compensated using a free knots B-spline method and a look-up table. Experiments are conducted in a realistic human cardiovascular phantom for preclinical evaluation. Repeatability experiments validate the systemÂ’s robustness. Furthermore, compared with the piecewise linear model, the proposed method achieves high accuracy with a median bending angle error of less than 0.8â—?

Medical Robot Systems,A Magnetic Capsule Robot with an Exoskeleton to Withstand Esophageal Pressure and Delivery Drug in Stomach,"Liu, Ruomao;Chen, Yujun;Yin, Zhen;Zhang, Jiachen","Keywords: Soft Robot Applications, Compliant Joints and Mechanisms, Robot Safety","Abstract: Capsule medicine is one of the most widely used methods of drug delivery into the human digestive tract. Packaging drugs into capsules not only prevents contamination of the drug before reaching the destination, but also protects the digestive organs and respiratory tract from potential damages caused by drug reactions. After reaching the targeted digestive organs, the drugs in the orally taken capsules usually can only be released passively. Most capsule robots that have been proposed to release drugs actively did not consider the compressed pressure when they pass through the esophagus, which could lead to premature drug release. This letter proposes a magnetic capsule robot that can withstand intra-esophageal pressure and also has the advantages of active locomotion and on-demand drug releasing. The proposed robot consists of two permanent magnets, an exoskeleton, and a soft non-magnetic container. Thus, it can withstand intra-esophageal pressure when it passes through the esophagus. This capsule robot can enter the stomach for targeted drug releasing without leaking liquid drugs along the path. The behavior of the robot is controllable using an external magnetic field thanks to the ring-shaped magnets mounted on the robot's top and bottom sections. The non-magnetic drug container will not be influenced by the external magnetic field during the locomotion to prevent leakage. The experiments show that this proposed capsule robot is more relevant to real-world medical applications thanks to its unique capability to withstand esophageal pressure.",,,,,,

Hence, the output force of these robots can hardly meet the demand for specific biomedical applications (e.g., tissue penetration). This article proposes a tetherless magnetic impact needle robot (MINRob) based on a triple-magnet system with reversible and repeatable magnetic collisions to overcome this constraint on output force. The working procedure of the proposed system is divided into several states, and a mathematical model is developed to predict and optimize the force output. Measured force values indicate a 10-fold increase compared with existing miniature robots that only utilize magnetic attractive force. Eventually, MINRob is integrated with a teleoperation system, enabling remote and precise control of the robot's position and orientation. The triple-magnet system offers promising locomotion patterns and penetration capacity via the notably increased force output, showing great potential in robot-assisted tissue penetration in minimally invasive healthcare.",,,,,,

To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple, plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering out their potentially unsafe actions. Due to its model-free nature and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL algorithms.

However, existing methods typically rely on a white-box dynamics model of the system, limiting their applicability in many practical robotics scenarios where only a black-box model of the system is available. In this work, we propose a novel reachability method to compute reachable sets and safe controllers for black-box dynamical systems. Our approach efficiently approximates the Hamiltonian function using samples from the black-box dynamics. This Hamiltonian is then used to solve the HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE), providing the reachable set of the system. The proposed method can be applied to general nonlinear systems and can be seamlessly integrated with existing reachability toolboxes for white-box systems to extend their use to black-box systems. Through simulation studies on a black-box slip-wheel car and a quadruped robot, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately obtaining the reachable sets for black-box dynamical systems.",,,,,,
Mechanism Design and Control,SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Systems,"Ciftci, Yusuf Umut;Chiu, Darren;Feng, Zeyuan;Sukhatme, Gaurav;Bansal, Somil","Keywords: Robot Safety, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a widely used approach in imitation learning, where a robot learns a control policy by observing an expert supervisor. However, the learned policy can make errors and might lead to safety violations, which limits their utility in safety-critical robotics applications. While prior works have tried improving a BC policy via additional real or synthetic action labels, adversarial training, or runtime filtering, none of them explicitly focus on reducing the BC policy's safety violations during training time. We propose SAFE-GIL, a design-time method to learn safety-aware behavior cloning policies. SAFE-GIL deliberately injects adversarial disturbance in the system during data collection to guide the expert towards safety-critical states. This disturbance injection simulates potential policy errors that the system might encounter during the test time. By ensuring that training more closely replicates expert behavior in safety-critical states, our approach results in safer policies despite policy errors during the test time. We further develop a reachability-based method to compute this adversarial disturbance. We compare SAFE-GIL with various behavior cloning techniques and online safety-filtering methods in three domains: autonomous ground navigation, aircraft taxiing, and aerial navigation on a quadrotor testbed. Our method demonstrates a significant reduction in safety failures, particularly in low data regimes where the likelihood of learning errors, and therefore safety violations, is higher.

Mechanism Design and Control,Computationally and Sample Efficient Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Adaptive Conformal Prediction,"Zhou, Hao;Zhang, Yanze;Luo, Wenhao","Keywords: Robot Safety, Model Learning for Control, Integrated Planning and Learning","Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in learning-enabled autonomous systems especially when deploying these systems in real-world scenarios. An important challenge is accurately quantifying the uncertainty of unknown models to generate provably safe control policies that facilitate the gathering of informative data, thereby achieving both safe and optimal policies. Additionally, the selection of the data-driven model can significantly impact both the real-time implementation and the uncertainty quantification process. In this paper, we propose a provably sample efficient episodic safe learning framework that remains robust across various model choices with quantified uncertainty for online control tasks. Specifically, we first employ Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) for kernel function approximation of Gaussian Processes (GPs) to enable efficient approximation of unknown dynamics. Then the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) is used to quantify the uncertainty from online observations and combined with the Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to characterize the uncertainty-aware safe control constraints under learned dynamics. Finally, an optimism-based exploration strategy is integrated with ACP-based CBFs for safe exploration and near-optimal safe nonlinear control. Theoretical proofs and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",,,,,,

W.;Pradalier, Cedric;Kousik, Shreyas","Keywords: Robot Safety, Model Learning for Control, Motion Control","Abstract: In the classical reach-avoid problem, autonomous mobile robots are tasked to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. However, it is difficult to provide guarantees on the robot's performance when the obstacles form a narrow gap and the robot is a black-box (i.e. the dynamics are not known analytically, but interacting with the system is cheap). To address this challenge, this paper presents NeuralPARC. The method extends the authors' prior Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to systems modeled by rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks, which are trained to represent parameterized trajectory data demonstrated by the robot. NeuralPARC computes the reachable set of the network while accounting for modeling error, and returns a set of states and parameters with which the black-box system is guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles. NeuralPARC is shown to outperform PARC, generating provably-safe extreme vehicle drift parking maneuvers in simulations and in real life on a model car, as well as enabling safety on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to large disturbances and controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy.",,,,,,

However, there remains a need for practical safety methods to justify widespread deployment. In particular, it is important to certify that a system obeys hard constraints on unsafe behavior in settings when it is unacceptable to design a tradeoff between performance and safety via tuning the policy (i.e. soft constraints). This leads to the question, how does enforcing hard constraints impact the performance (meaning safely completing tasks) of an IL policy? To answer this question, this paper builds a reachability-based safety filter to enforce hard constraints on IL, which we call Reachability-Aided Imitation Learning (RAIL). Through evaluations with state-of-the-art IL policies in mobile robots and manipulation tasks, we make two key findings. First, the highest-performing policies are sometimes only so because they frequently violate constraints, and significantly lose performance under hard constraints. Second, surprisingly, hard constraints on the lower-performing policies can occasionally increase their ability to perform tasks safely. Finally, hardware evaluation confirms the method can operate in real time. More results can be found at our website: https://safe-robotics-lab-gt.github.io/rail/.",,,,,,
Mechanism Design and Control,Safe Reinforcement Learning of Robot Trajectories in the Presence of Moving Obstacles,"Kiemel, Jonas;Righetti, Ludovic;Kroeger, Torsten;Asfour, Tamim","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Robot Safety, Motion Control","Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for learning collision-free robot trajectories in the presence of moving obstacles. As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.",,,,,,

The role of fixture layout planning has evolved from being performed by experienced engineers to computational methods due to the number of possible configurations for components. Current optimisation methods commonly fall into sub-optimal positions due to the existence of local optima, with data-driven machine learning techniques relying on costly to collect labelled training data.

To this end, we design a reinforcement learning agent that builds on the concept of tire energy absorption to autonomously drift through changing and complex waypoint configurations while safely staying within track bounds. We achieve zero-shot deployment on the car by training the agent in a simulation environment built on top of a neural stochastic differential equation vehicle model learned from pre-collected driving data.

Reinforcement Learning 3,Sample-Efficient Unsupervised Policy Cloning from Ensemble Self-Supervised Labeled Videos,"Liu, Xin;Chen, Yaran;Li, Haoran","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, action-labeled expert trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet videos, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from action-free videos without rewards and any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both action-free videos and reward-free interactions for robust dynamics understanding and advanced action prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient, unsupervised, and iterative training process, UPESV obtains an advanced policy based on a robust video labeling model. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art interaction-limited policy learning performance (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except for videos.",,,,,,

To represent these kinds of domains, we adopt hidden-parameter Markov decision processes (HIP-MDPs), which model sequential decision problems where hidden variables parameterize transition and reward functions. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, and meta-learning, simply treat the effect of hidden parameters as additional variance and often struggle to effectively handle HIP-MDP problems, especially when the rewards are parameterized by hidden variables. We introduce PrivilegedDreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that extends the existing model-based approach by incorporating an explicit parameter estimation module. PrivilegedDreamer features its novel dual recurrent architecture that explicitly estimates hidden parameters from limited historical data and enables us to condition the model, actor, and critic networks on these estimated parameters.

Our approach is straightforward to integrate with off-the-shelf MPC frameworks and enables learning solely from task space demonstrations with sparsely labeled transitions, while leveraging MPC to ensure smooth joint space motions and constraint satisfaction. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments on a Franka Panda robot performing the robot waiter task and demonstrate robust deployment of value functions learned from 50-100 demonstrations.

We propose Visual Alignment Testing, an experimental framework designed to evaluate the validity of this functional separation. Our results indicate that in E2E-trained models, visual encoders actively contribute to decision-making resulting from motor data supervision, contradicting the assumed functional separation. In contrast, OOD-pretrained models, where encoders lack this capability, experience an average performance drop of 42% in our benchmark results, compared to the state-of-the-art performance achieved by E2E policies.

Thus, we dub this incremental SDF reconstruction for AW as AiSDF. Within the online framework, we infer the underlying Atlanta structure of a given scene and then estimate planar surfel regions supporting the Atlanta structure. This Atlanta-aware surfel representation provides an explicit planar map for a given scene. In addition, based on these Atlanta planar surfel regions, we adaptively sample and constrain the structural regularity in the SDF reconstruction, which enables us to improve the reconstruction quality by maintaining a high-level structure while enhancing the details of a given scene.

Inspired by the insights, We propose a set of systematic designs that lead to performance and safety improvements of up to 1.65Ã— and 14Ã—, respectively.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Perception 1,MORDA: A Synthetic Dataset to Facilitate Adaptation of Object Detectors to Unseen Real-Target Domain While Preserving Performance on Real-Source Domain,"Lim, Hojun;Yoo, Heecheol;Lee, Jinwoo;Jeon, Seungmin;Jeon, Hyeongseok","Keywords: Data Sets for Robotic Vision, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization","Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) based perception models are indispensable in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, their reliance on large-scale, high-quality data is broadly recognized as a burdensome necessity due to the substantial cost of data acquisition and labeling. Further, the issue is not a one-time concern as AVs might need a new dataset if they are to be deployed to another region (real-target domain) that the in-hand dataset within the real-source domain cannot incorporate. To mitigate this burden, we propose leveraging synthetic environments as an auxiliary domain where the characteristics of real domains are reproduced. This approach could enable indirect experience about the real-target domain in a time- and cost-effective manner. As a practical demonstration of our methodology, nuScenes and South Korea are employed to represent real-source and real-target domains, respectively. That means we construct digital twins for several regions of South Korea, and the data-acquisition framework of nuScenes is reproduced. Blending the aforementioned components within a simulator allows us to obtain a synthetic-fusion domain in which we forge our novel driving dataset, MORDA: Mixture Of Real-domain characteristics for synthetic-data-assisted Domain Adaptation. To verify the value of synthetic features that MORDA provides in learning about driving environments of South Korea, 2D/3D detectors are trained solely on a combination of nuScenes and MORDA. Afterward, their performance is evaluated on the unforeseen real-world dataset(AI-Hub) collected in South Korea. Our experiments present that MORDA can significantly improve mean Average Precision (mAP) on AI-Hub dataset while that on nuScenes is retained or slightly enhanced.

We propose a new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency. Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP) framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1) latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical data regardless of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a mechanism that compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online performance that closely aligns with 80% of its offline evaluation on the Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.",,,,,,

However, these models often sacrifice interpretability, posing significant challenges to trust, safety, and regulatory compliance. To address these issues, we introduce DRIVE -- Dependable Robust Interpretable Visionary Ensemble Framework in Autonomous Driving, a comprehensive framework designed to improve the dependability and stability of explanations in end-to-end unsupervised autonomous driving models. Our work specifically targets the inherent instability problems observed in the Driving through the Concept Gridlock (DCG) model, which undermine the trustworthiness of its explanations and decision-making processes. We define four key attributes of textbf{DRIVE}: consistent interpretability, stable interpretability, consistent output, and stable output. These attributes collectively ensure that explanations remain reliable and robust across different scenarios and perturbations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the stability and dependability of explanations, thereby addressing the limitations of current models. Our contributions include an in-depth analysis of the dependability issues within the DCG model, a rigorous definition of DRIVE with its fundamental properties, a framework to implement DRIVE, and novel metrics for evaluating the dependability of concept-based explainable autonomous driving models.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by visionlanguage foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chainof-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event camerasÂ’ high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions.

Novel Sensors,Tool-Mediated Robot Perception of Granular Substances Using Multiple Sensory Modalities,"Liu, Si;Sinapov, Jivko","Keywords: Recognition, Learning Categories and Concepts, Robot Audition","Abstract: People use tools to interact with and perceive the world, with multimodal sensory inputs forming the basis of how we understand our environment. For example, a blind person uses a walking cane to tap the road and detect obstacles, and a builder uses a hammer to strike a wall to assess its structural integrity. Using tools extends our sensory capabilities during exploratory behaviors, enabling us to perceive object properties that are otherwise inaccessible. Inspired by this cognitive process, we propose a framework in which a multi-sensory robot employs exploratory behaviors using various tools to recognize granular substances. Our framework effectively integrates multiple non-visual sensory inputs (e.g., audio, haptic, and tactile) gathered through multiple tools (e.g., spoon, fork) and behaviors (e.g., stirring, poking) to perceive object properties. The framework segments interactions into time windows and aligns different modalities, enhancing data efficiency and interactive perception. Additionally, we conducted tool-transfer experiments to evaluate similarities between tools. Our experiments demonstrate that combining multiple tools and behaviors outperforms single-tool and single-behavior approaches. While the audio modality dominates the non-visual multimodal system, other modalities contribute. We further demonstrate that tool similarities vary depending on the behavior, and notably, the robot does not need to complete entire interactions to achieve optimal recognition accuracy.",,,,,,

To overcome this problem, we propose an integration of an OCT sensor to a 6-DOF robot arm end-effector combined with a geometry-aware stitching model for surface and volumetric data stitching. We firstly develop a simple but efficient Robot-OCT calibration method by using a three-marker calibration pattern and implement an optimization solver.

This letter proposes an adaptive abrupt disturbance-rejection sliding mode controller (SMC). To address the increased variability in the disturbance boundaries caused by abrupt transitions, a new adaptive disturbance observer (ADOB) is designed to improve the tracking robustness and weaken the chattering of SMC by generating auxiliary system variables without depending on any prior boundary information about disturbance and its change rate. Then, a novel barrier function (BF)-based switching law is constructed to suppress the residual-disturbance estimation error of the ADOB at the transient state, which achieves the tradeoffs between the necessary sufficient gain and chattering by avoiding gain overestimation. The finite-time Lyapunov stability of the sliding variables and the estimated errors have been proved theoretically. The practical effectiveness is illustrated in experiments with the custom-developed WMRs.",,,,,,

Integrating Motion Planning and Learning 1,Learning to Refine Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions Via Uncertainty-Aware Online Parameter Adaptation,"Kim, Taekyung;Kee, Robin Inho;Panagou, Dimitra","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Integrated Planning and Control, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring safety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-RÃ©nyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters.

Coupled with a topological map construction strategy that groups obstacles to be as convex as possible, a goal-adaptive navigation framework is proposed to efficiently plan multiple candidate trajectories. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed GA-TEB framework effectively prevents deadlock situations, where the robot becomes frozen due to a lack of feasible trajectories in crowded environments.

However, neither of these methods can concurrently guarantee both high-quality and high-efficiency reconstruction of 3D unknown objects. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a crucial hypothesis: with the availability of more information about the unknown object, the prediction quality of the SCVP network improves. There are two ways to provide extra information: (1) leveraging perception data obtained from NBVs, and (2) training on an expanded dataset of multiview inputs.

But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is utilized to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks.

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.",,,,,,

The dynamics is given by mimicking Ackerman steering model for the dynamics of position and orientation, associated with the actuator dynamics of the tail wheel's angle modeled by a first-order response with respect to the robot's angular velocity. First we develop a nominal trajectory tracking control law to track a given desired trajectory by applying differential-flatness property of the unicycle model and backstepping approach to handle the actuator dynamics. The effectiveness of the trajectory tracking is demonstrated by conducting hardware robot experiment after performing system identification, which illustrates the superior performance over a benchmark method. The design is also extended to an adaptive tracking control under parameter uncertainty in the tail wheel dynamics through introducing the adaptation law of the parameters, and the performance is demonstrated in numerical simulation.",,,,,,
Object Detection 2,OPRNet: Object-Centric Point Reconstruction Network for Multimodal 3D Object Detection in Adverse Weathers,"Yoon, Jaehyun;Jung, JongWon;Lee, Eungi;Yoo, Seok Bong","Keywords: Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Computer Vision for Automation, Sensor Fusion","Abstract: The development of a multimodal fusion technique utilizing LiDAR-camera data has enabled precise 3D object detection for self-driving vehicles, particularly in ideal conditions with clear weather. Nevertheless, adverse weathers such as fog, snow, and rain remain a challenge for existing multimodal methods. These conditions lead to a reduced density of point clouds as a result of laser signal occlusion and attenuation. Additionally, as the distance grows, the point cloud becomes sparser, further challenging object detection tasks. To address these problems, we introduce a point reconstruction network employing equirectangular projection tailored for multimodal 3D object detection. This network incorporates a range-constrained noise filter to remove noise caused by adverse weather and an object-centric point generator designed to flexibly generate points for distant objects. Moreover, we propose a dual 2D auxiliary module to enhance image features and support the point reconstruction. Experimental evaluations conducted on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that the suggested approach surpasses current techniques.

Our method enhances detection performance by integrating data from both event-based and visible light cameras. We have designed three key modules: The Gated Event Accumulation Representation module (GEAR), the Temporal Feature Selection module (TFS), and the Adaptive Fusion module (AF). GEAR and TFS enhance temporal feature fusion at both image and feature levels, while AF effectively integrates multi-modal features with low computational complexity.

A key element of this is robust and accurate drone detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects, localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall 95% average precision (AP) and 85% average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.",,,,,,
Object Detection 2,CA-IoU: Central-Gaussian Angle-IoU for Robust Bounding Box Regression,"Jang, Junbo;Kim, Dohoon;Paik, Joonki","Keywords: Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization","Abstract: Accurate object detection depends on the precise refinement of bounding box regression. Recent advancements in bounding box regression have introduced a variety of methodologies aimed at reducing the disparity between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. The prevailing objective functions for bounding box regression typically encompass three key perspectives: 1) Intersection over Union (IoU), 2) distance between central points, and 3) aspect ratio alignment. Nonetheless, these existing loss functions encounter two primary challenges including slow convergence of the distance term and aspect ratio variation irrelevant to bounding box localization. This paper presents two novel loss terms to address these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the concept of the Integral of Central-Gaussian, a novel approach that leverages the cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from a closed-form Gaussian distribution based on the central points of bounding boxes. Secondly, we introduce an alternative aspect ratio representation by minimizing the angle between two bounding boxes in direct proportion to their IoU. We term this comprehensive loss function ``Central-Gaussian Angle-IoU"" (CA-IoU), seamlessly incorporating the Integral of Central-Gaussian with angle-based IoU. Extensive experiments on various models and benchmarks for object detection highlight the superior performance of CA-IoU loss compared to existing bounding box regression methods. The source code and the corresponding trained models will be made available.",,,,,,

The approach is proposed for use on board of autonomous aerial vehicles equipped with a 3D LiDAR sensor. It relies on a novel 3D occupancy voxel mapping method for the target detection that provides high localization accuracy and robustness with respect to varying environments and appearance changes of the target. In combination with a proposed cluster-based multi-target tracker, sporadic false positives are suppressed, state estimation of the target is provided, and the detection latency is negligible. This makes the system suitable for tasks of agile multi-robot interaction, such as autonomous aerial interception or formation control where fast, precise, and robust relative localization of other robots is crucial. We evaluate the viability and performance of the system in simulated and real-world experiments which demonstrate that at a range of 20m, our system is capable of reliably detecting a micro-scale UAV with an almost 100% recall, 0.2m accuracy, and 20ms delay.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots: Planning and Control,Improving Disturbance Estimation and Suppression Via Learning among Systems with Mismatched Dynamics,"Modi, Harsh Jashvantbhai;Chen, Zhu;Liang, Xiao;Zheng, Minghui","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Motion Control","Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) is a method for reducing system tracking or estimation errors over multiple iterations by using information from past iterations. The disturbance observer (DOB) is used to estimate and mitigate disturbances within the system, while the system is being affected by them. ILC enhances system performance by introducing a feedforward signal in each iteration. However, its effectiveness may diminish if the conditions change during the iterations. On the other hand, although DOB effectively mitigates the effects of new disturbances, it cannot entirely eliminate them as it operates reactively. Therefore, neither ILC nor DOB alone can ensure sufficient robustness in challenging scenarios. This study focuses on the simultaneous utilization of ILC and DOB to enhance system robustness. The proposed methodology specifically targets dynamically different linearized systems performing repetitive tasks. The systems share similar forms but differ in dynamics (e.g. sizes, masses, and controllers). Consequently, the design of learning filters must account for these differences in dynamics. To validate the approach, the study establishes a theoretical framework for designing learning filters in conjunction with DOB. The validity of the framework is then confirmed through numerical studies and experimental tests conducted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although UAVs are nonlinear systems, the study employs a linearized controller as they operate in proximity to the hover condition.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots: Planning and Control,Learning Speed Adaptation for Flight in Clutter,"Zhao, Guangyu;Wu, Tianyue;Chen, Yeke;Gao, Fei","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Motion and Path Planning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Animals learn to adapt speed of their movements to their capabilities and the environment they observe. Mobile robots should also demonstrate this ability to trade-off aggressiveness and safety for efficiently accomplishing tasks. The aim of this work is to endow flight vehicles with the ability of speed adaptation in prior unknown and partially observable cluttered environments. We propose a hierarchical learning and planning system where we utilize both well-established methods of model-based trajectory generation and trial-and-error that comprehensively learns a policy to dynamically configure the speed constraint. Technically, we use online reinforcement learning to obtain the deployable policy. The statistical results in simulation demonstrate the advantages of our method over the constant speed constraint baselines and an alternative method in terms of flight efficiency and safety. In particular, the policy behaves perception awareness, which distinguish it from alternative approaches. By deploying the policy to hardware, we verify that these advantages can be brought to the real world.",,,,,,

However, existing designs are typically single-mode: either safeguarded by propeller guards that prevent deformation or deformable but lacking rigidity, which is crucial for stable flight in open environments. This paper introduces DART, a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT, that adapts its post-collision response by either engaging a locking mechanism for a rigid mode or disengaging it for a flexible mode, respectively. Comprehensive characterization tests highlight the significant difference in post-collision responses between its rigid and flexible modes, with the rigid mode offering seven times higher stiffness compared to the flexible mode. To understand and harness the collision dynamics, we propose a novel collision response prediction model based on the linear complementarity system theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of predicting collision forces for both the rigid and flexible modes of DART. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the model and underscore its potential to advance collision-inclusive trajectory planning in aerial robotics.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots: Planning and Control,Learning Quadrotor Control from Visual Features Using Differentiable Simulation,"Heeg, Johannes;Song, Yunlong;Scaramuzza, Davide","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: The sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant challenge in robotics. RL requires large-scale simulation and can still cause long training times, slowing research and innovation. This issue is particularly pronounced in vision-based control tasks where reliable state estimates are not accessible. Differentiable simulation offers an alternative by enabling gradient back-propagation through the dynamics model, providing low-variance analytical policy gradients and, hence, higher sample efficiency. However, its usage for real-world robotic tasks has yet been limited. This work demonstrates the great potential of differentiable simulation for learning quadrotor control. We show that training in differentiable simulation significantly outperforms model-free RL in terms of both sample efficiency and training time, allowing a policy to learn to recover a quadrotor in seconds when providing vehicle states and in minutes when relying solely on visual features. The key to our success is two-fold. First, the use of a simple surrogate model for gradient computation greatly accelerates training without sacrificing control performance. Second, combining state representation learning with policy learning enhances convergence speed in tasks where only visual features are observable. These findings highlight the potential of differentiable simulation for real-world robotics and offer a compelling alternative to conventional RL approaches.",,,,,,

Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.",,,,,,

Agile planning using existing non-linear model predictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it becomes increasingly computationally demanding. This reduces the prediction horizon length, which leads to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighbourhood. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by introducing variable time-steps and coupling them with the prediction horizon length.

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses.

However, in transurethral urological surgical robots, they need to work in a liquid environment. This causes vaporization of the liquid when shearing and heating is performed, resulting in bubble atomization that affects the visual perception of the robot. This can lead to the need for uninterrupted pauses in the surgical procedure, which makes the surgery take longer. To address the atomization characteristics of liquids under urological surgical robotic vision, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot dehaze method (RSF-Dehaze).

With vision-based navigation, when combined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover position and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In practice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is complicated by significant texture differences. Although methods such as style transfer can be used to address this issue, they require large datasets from both source and target domains with prolonged training times. This paper proposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian splatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast training time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the first phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as differential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance related parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual content. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and depth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images.

Representation Learning 1,P3-PO: Prescriptive Point Priors for Visuo-Spatial Generalization of Robot Policies,"Levy, Mara;Haldar, Siddhant;Pinto, Lerrel;Shrivastava, Abhinav","Keywords: Deep Learning Methods, Representation Learning, Visual Learning","Abstract: Developing generalizable robot policies that can robustly handle varied environmental conditions and object instances remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While considerable efforts have focused on collecting large robot datasets and developing policy architectures to learn from such data, naively learning from visual inputs often results in brittle policies that fail to transfer beyond the training data. This work presents Prescriptive Point Priors for Policies or P3-PO, a novel framework that constructs a unique state representation of the environment leveraging recent advances in computer vision and robot learning to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization for robot manipulation. This representation is obtained through two steps. First, a human annotator prescribes a set of semantically meaningful points on a single demonstration frame. These points are then propagated through the dataset using off-the-shelf vision models. The derived points serve as an input to state-of-the-art policy architectures for policy learning. Our experiments across four real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 43% absolute improvement over prior methods when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, P3-PO exhibits 58% and 80% gains across tasks for new object instances and more cluttered environments respectively.

Representation Learning 1,APA-BI: Adaptive Partition Aggregation and Bidirectional Integration for UAV-View Geo-Localization,"Zhang, Xichen;Zhao, Shuying;Zhang, Yunzhou;Ge, Fawei;Zhao, Bin;Zhang, Yizhong","Keywords: Representation Learning, Localization, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: The task of UAV-view geo-localization is to match a query image with database images to estimate the current geographic location of the query image. This is particularly useful in environments where GPS is not available or when the device fails. Although deep learning methods make sufficient progress in UAV-view geo-localization, they still face challenges in improving the distinguishability of features. For instance, some feature aggregation methods do not consider semantic integrity, and robust elements in the image are not given enough attention. This paper proposes a UAV-view geo-localization method (APA-BI) to tackle the above issues. Specifically, we propose an adaptive partition aggregation method to ensure feature integrity at the semantic level by increasing the receptive field of the classifier module. At the same time, we design a bidirectional integration module to further enhance feature distinguishability by extracting robust tubular topological structures from images. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that APA-BI achieves impressive retrieval accuracy and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the test results of APA-BI in real-world scenarios also show excellent performance.",,,,,,

Directly annotating multimodal instructions for model training proves impractical, due to the sparsity of paired multimodal data. In this study, we demonstrate that by leveraging unimodal instructions abundant in real data, we can effectively teach robots to learn multimodal task specifications. First, we endow the robot with strong Crossmodality Alignment capabilities, by pretraining a robotic multimodal encoder using extensive out-of-domain data. Then, we employ two Collapse and Corrupt operations to further bridge the remaining modality gap in the learned multimodal representation. This approach projects different modalities of identical task goal as interchangeable representations, thus enabling accurate robotic operations within a well-aligned multimodal latent space. Evaluation across more than 130 tasks and 4000 evaluations on both simulated LIBERO benchmark and real robot platforms showcases the superior capabilities of our proposed framework, demonstrating significant potential in overcoming data constraints in robotic learning.

Representation Learning 1,Model Free Method of Screening Training Data for Adversarial Datapoints through Local Lipschitz Quotient Analysis,"Kamienski, Emily;Asada, Harry","Keywords: Deep learning methods, data sets for robot learning, Lipschitz quotient, data preparation, adversarial data","Abstract: It is often challenging to pick suitable data features for learning problems. Sometimes certain regions of the data are harder to learn because they are not well characterized by the data features. The challenge is amplified when resources for sensing and computation are limited and time-critical yet reliable decisions must be made. For example, a robotic system for preventing falls of elderly people needs a real-time fall predictor, with low false positive and false negative rates, using a simple wearable sensor to activate a fall prevention mechanism. Here we present a methodology for assessing the learnability of data based on the Lipschitz quotient. We develop a procedure for determining which regions of the dataset contain adversarial data points, input data that look similar but belong to different target classes. Regardless of the learning model, it will be hard to learn such data. We then present a method for determining which additional feature(s) are most effective in improving the predictability of each of these regions. This is a model-independent data analysis that can be executed before constructing a prediction model through machine learning or other techniques. We demonstrate this method on two synthetic datasets and a data set of human falls, which uses inertial measurement unit signals. For the fall dataset, we were able to identify two groups of adversarial data points and improve the predictability of each group over the baseline dataset as assessed by Lipschitz by using 2 different sets of features. This work offers a valuable tool for assessing data learnability that can be applied to not only fall prediction problems, but also other robotics applications that learn from data.",,,,,,
Representation Learning 1,3D Space Perception Via Disparity Learning Using Stereo Images and an Attention Mechanism: Real-Time Grasping Motion Generation for Transparent Objects,"Cai, Xianbo;Ito, Hiroshi;Hiruma, Hyogo;Ogata, Tetsuya","Keywords: Representation Learning, Perception-Action Coupling","Abstract: Object grasping in 3D space is crucial for robotic applications. Such tasks are performed by utilizing depth map data acquired from RGB-D images or 3D point cloud data. However, these methods struggle when dealing with transparent objects, as transparency limits sensor performance when predicting depth maps. Additionally, the grasping motions are predicted without incorporating the relationship between depth data and motion information, which limits the motionÂ’s flexibility. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose an end-to-end motion generation model using stereo RGB images, a deep-learning model that incorporates image and motion information. Furthermore, visual attention mechanisms are used for extracting task-related attention points, which is essential for building spatial cognition constructs. Real-robot experimental results confirmed that the proposed model is able to grasp transparent objects under various situations, including unseen positions, heights, and background. It was also found that the model self-organized a spatial cognition representation within its hidden states, suggesting that the integrated learning of robot motion and stable spatial attention points is important for spatial perception. Such explicit feature representations cannot be obtained via learning motion alone.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 4,Making a Complete Mess and Getting Away with It: Traveling Salesperson Problems with Circle Placement Variants,"Woller, David;Mansouri, Masoumeh;Kulich, Miroslav","Keywords: Task and Motion Planning, Constrained Motion Planning, Computational Geometry","Abstract: This paper explores a variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where the agent places a circular obstacle next to each node once it visits it. Referred to as the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Circle Placement (TSP-CP), the aim is to maximize the obstacle radius for which a valid closed tour exists and then minimize the tour cost. The TSP-CP finds relevance in various real-world applications, such as harvesting, quarrying, and open-pit mining. We propose several novel solvers to address the TSP-CP, its variant tailored for Dubins vehicles, and a crucial subproblem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem on self-deleting graphs (TSP-SD). Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed solvers outperform the current state-of-the-art on related problems in solution quality.",,,,,,

Given that deep penetration into the environment can cause optimization failure, we propose a framework to ensure feasibility throughout the process using a series of subproblems tailored for narrow passage problem. We begin by decomposing the environment into convex objects and initializing collision constraints with a subset of these objects. By continuously interpolating the collision constraints through the process of sequentially introducing remaining objects, our proposed framework generates subproblems that guide the optimization toward solving the narrow passage problem. Several examples are presented to demonstrate how the proposed framework addresses narrow passage path planning problems.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 4,Trajectory Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Costs Using Deterministic Path Integral Optimization,"Halder, Patrick;Homburger, Hannes;Kiltz, Lothar;Reuter, Johannes;Althoff, Matthias","Keywords: Task and Motion Planning, Optimization and Optimal Control, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: Formulating the intended behavior of a dynamic system can be challenging. Signal temporal logic (STL) is frequently used for this purpose due to its suitability in formalizing comprehensible, modular, and versatile spatio-temporal specifications. Due to scaling issues with respect to the complexity of the specifications and the potential occurrence of non-differentiable terms, classical optimization methods often solve STL-based problems inefficiently. Smoothing and approximation techniques can alleviate these issues but require changing the optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel sampling-based method based on model predictive path integral control to solve optimal control problems with STL cost functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark motion planning problems and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method efficiently solves optimal control problems with STL costs.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 4,Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Conflict-Based Search and Structural-Semantic Topometric Maps,"Fredriksson, Scott;Bai, Yifan;Saradagi, Akshit;Nikolakopoulos, George","Keywords: Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Motion and Path Planning, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: As industries increasingly adopt large robotic fleets, there is a pressing need for computationally efficient, practical, and optimal conflict-free path planning for multiple robots. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular method for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) due to its completeness and optimality; however, it is often impractical for real-world applications, as it is computationally intensive to solve and relies on assumptions about agents and operating environments that are difficult to realize. This article proposes a solution to overcome computational challenges and practicality issues of CBS by utilizing structural-semantic topometric maps. Instead of running CBS over large grid-based maps, the proposed solution runs CBS over a sparse topometric map containing structural-semantic cells representing intersections, pathways, and dead ends. This approach significantly accelerates the MAPF process and reduces the number of conflict resolutions handled by CBS while operating in continuous time. In the proposed method, robots are assigned time ranges to move between topometric regions, departing from the traditional CBS assumption that a robot can move to any connected cell in a single time step. The approach is validated through real-world multi-robot path-finding experiments and benchmarking simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MAPF method can be applied to real-world non-holonomic robots and yields significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to traditional CBS methods while improving conflict detection and resolution in cases of corridor symmetries.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 4,"Topo-Geometrically Distinct Path Computation Using Neighborhood-Augmented Graph, and Its Application to Path Planning for a Tethered Robot in 3D","Sahin, Alp;Bhattacharya, Subhrajit","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Optimization and Optimal Control, Foundations of Automation, Multi Path Planning","Abstract: Many robotics applications benefit from being able to compute multiple geodesic paths in a given configuration space. Existing paradigm is to use topological path planning, which can compute optimal paths in distinct topological classes. However, these methods usually require non-trivial geometric constructions which are prohibitively expensive in 3D, and are unable to distinguish between distinct topologically equivalent geodesics that are created due to high-cost/curvature regions or prismatic obstacles in 3D. In this paper, we propose an approach to compute k geodesic paths using the concept of a novel neighborhood-augmented graph, on which graph search algorithms can compute multiple optimal paths that are topo-geometrically distinct. Our approach does not require complex geometric constructions, and the resulting paths are not restricted to distinct topological classes, making the algorithm suitable for problems where finding and distinguishing between geodesic paths are of interest. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm to planning shortest traversible paths for a tethered robot in 3D with cable-length constraint.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 4,Homotopy-Aware Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Cluttered Environments,"Menon, Ashwin;Damm, Eric;Howard, Thomas","Keywords: Field Robots, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: Mobile robot navigation architectures that employ a planning algorithm to provide a single optimal path to follow are flawed in the presence of unstructured, rapidly changing environments. As the environment updates, optimal plans often oscillate around discrete obstacles, which is problematic for path following controllers that are biased to follow the planned route. A potentially better approach involves the generation of multiple plans, each optimal within their own homotopy class, to provide a more comprehensive approximation of cost to goal for a path-following controller. In this paper, we present Homotopy-Aware Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (HAEASL), which uses multiple open lists to bias search towards routes with distinct homotopy classes. Experiments are presented that measure the number, the optimality, and the diversity of solutions generated across 3,200 planning problems in 80 randomly generated environments. The performance of HAEASL is benchmarked against two previous approaches: Search-Based Path Planning with Homotopy Class Constraints (A*HC) and Homotopy-Aware RRT* (HARRT*). Experimental results demonstrate that HAEASL can generate a greater number of paths and more diverse paths than A*HC without a significant reduction of optimality. Additionally, results demonstrate that HAEASL generates a greater number of paths and ones with lower costs than HARRT*. A final demonstration of HAEASL generating multiple solutions subject to temporal, resource, and kinodynamic constraints using data collected from an off-road mobile robot illustrates the suitability of the approach for the motivating example.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot and Human-Robot Teams,Initial Task Allocation in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams: An Attention-Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Wang, Ruiqi;Zhao, Dezhong;Gupte, Arjun;Min, Byung-Cheol","Keywords: Human-Robot Teaming, Human-Robot Collaboration, Design and Human Factors","Abstract: Multi-human multi-robot teams (MH-MR) obtain tremendous potential in tackling intricate and massive missions by merging distinct strengths and expertise of individual members. The inherent heterogeneity of these teams necessitates advanced initial task allocation (ITA) methods that align tasks with the intrinsic capabilities of team members from the outset. While existing reinforcement learning approaches show encouraging results, they might fall short in addressing the nuances of long-horizon ITA problems, particularly in settings with large-scale MH-MR teams or multifaceted tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose an attention-enhanced hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that decomposes the complex ITA problem into structured sub-problems, facilitating more efficient allocations. To bolster sub-policy learning, we introduce a hierarchical cross-attribute attention (HCA) mechanism, encouraging each sub-policy within the hierarchy to discern and leverage the specific nuances in the state space that are crucial for its respective decision-making phase. Through an extensive environmental surveillance case study, we demonstrate the benefits of our model and the HCA inside.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot and Human-Robot Teams,Enabling Multi-Robot Collaboration from Single-Human Guidance,"Ji, Zhengran;Zhang, Lingyu;Sajda, Paul;Chen, Boyuan","Keywords: Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop, Learning from Demonstration, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: Learning collaborative behaviors is essential for multi-agent systems. Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. We instead propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans have the natural ability to take on various roles in a team. We show that by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period of time and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates, agents can effectively learn to collaborate. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.",,,,,,

The commonly used models rely on neglect time, the time an agent operates independently, which confounds both human and robot abilities. The proposed model separates neglect time into two functionally distinct concepts: the time a robot can operate self-sufficiently, and the time a human estimates the robot can do so. Previous research indicates fan-out is often overestimated. This work explains why robot ability provides an upper bound to fanout, but that actual achieved fan-out is influenced by both the human and robot abilities. We conduct a study to validate this new model and show improved performance over the two most common fan-out models. The results show that both previous models overestimate as predicted. Using the new fan-out model, we show that as the difference between human estimation and robot abilities grows, the actual fan-out will fall further from the upper bound potential fan-out. By including assessments of both the robotic and human elements, the new model provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics at play and the factors involved in scaling Human Multi-Robot Teams.",,,,,,

Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission.

Our work aims to assist in this goal by enabling robots to inform their users of dangerous or unsanitary anomalies in their home. Some examples of these anomalies include the user leaving their milk out, forgetting to turn off the stove, or leaving poison accessible to children. To move towards enabling home robots with these abilities, we have created a new dataset, which we call SafetyDetect. The SafetyDetect dataset consists of 1000 anomalous home scenes, each of which contains unsafe or unsanitary situations for an agent to detect. Our approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) alongside both a graph representation of the scene and the relationships between the objects in the scene. Our key insight is that this connected scene graph and the object relationships it encodes enables the LLM to better reason about the scene --- especially as it relates to detecting dangerous or unsanitary situations. Our most promising approach utilizes GPT-4 and pursues a classification technique where object relations from the scene graph are classified as normal, dangerous, unsanitary, or dangerous for children. This method is able to correctly identify over 90% of anomalous scenarios in the SafetyDetect Dataset.

In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions.

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains can be used to predict a sequence of abstract actions for completing such tasks, although the agent may not be able to execute this sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge.

Traditional methods often struggle with the challenges posed by a lack of environmental topography integration, especially when interactions between wind and obstacles distort gas dispersion patterns. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach, which leverages spatial context and environmental mapping to enhance gas source localization. By integrating Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a U-Net-based model, our method predicts the likelihood of gas source locations by analyzing gas sensor data, wind flow, and topography of the environment represented by a 2D occupancy map. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a wheeled robot equipped with a photoionization detector, a LIDAR, and an anemometer, in various scenarios with dynamic wind fields and multiple obstacles. The results show that our approach can robustly locate gas sources, even in challenging environments with fluctuating wind directions, outperforming conventional methods by utilizing topography contextual information. This study underscores the importance of topographical context in gas source localization and offers a flexible and robust solution for real-world applications.

"Information Gathering, Planning and Control in Challenging Environments",Gas Source Localization in Unknown Indoor Environments Using Dual-Mode Information-Theoretic Search,"Kim, Seunghwan;Seo, Jaemin;Jang, Hongro;Kim, Changseung;Kim, Murim;Pyo, Juhyun;Oh, Hyondong","Keywords: Planning under Uncertainty, Environment Monitoring and Management, Robotics in Hazardous Fields","Abstract: This paper proposes a dual-mode planner for localizing gas sources using a mobile sensor in unknown indoor spaces. The complexity of indoor environments creates constraints on search paths, leading to situations where no valid paths can be generated, which are termed as dead end in this paper. The proposed dual-mode planner is designed to effectively address the dead end problem while maintaining efficient search paths. In addition, the absence of analytical dispersion models that can be used in unknown indoor environments presents another critical issue for indoor gas source localization (GSL). To address this, we present an indoor Gaussian dispersion model (IGDM) that can analytically model indoor gas dispersion without a complete map. Finally, we establish a GSL framework for indoor environments along with real-time mapping, utilizing the dual-mode planner and IGDM. This framework is validated in indoor scenarios with the realistic gas dispersion simulator. The simulation results show the high success rate of the proposed method, its ability to reduce search time, and its computational efficiency. Furthermore, through real-world experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach as a practical solution, evidenced by its satisfactory performance",,,,,,
Wearable Robotics 2,Online Design Optimization of Passive Exoskeletons Using Fast Biomechanics Simulation and Reinforcement Learning,"Vatsal, Vighnesh","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Reinforcement Learning, Modeling and Simulating Humans","Abstract: Exoskeletons are being adopted as assistive devices in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and construction, aimed at reducing musculoskeletal loads in workers. Presently, their design process assumes the user to be quasi-static, optimizing the design parameters for reduction of human joint torques followed by fine-tuning through usability studies and physical prototyping. We present a method for optimizing passive exoskeleton designs before the physical prototyping stage for muscle effort reduction in dynamic tasks such as arm reaching and walking. We employ fast MuJoCo-based simulations of human biomechanics to compute the joint torques, muscle forces and muscle activations while executing task trajectories using pre-trained reinforcement learning models from the literature. We train another set of reinforcement learning models that minimize joint torques and muscle effort rates by varying the exoskeleton's design parameters online during the task motions. Baselines for comparison include the default designs of shoulder and walking assist exoskeletons from the literature, and designs obtained through conventional optimization techniques. In terms of muscle effort rates, the RL-based designs improved upon these baselines by an average of 3.42% and 1.96% respectively in the arm reaching task, and 6.28% and 5.81% in the walking task. Our method can be adapted to evaluate exoskeletons in real-time through motion capture, and for muscle-aware online control of powered exoskeletons.",,,,,,
Wearable Robotics 2,Accurately Modeling the Output Torque and Stiffness of Ankle-Foot Orthoses with a Compliant Linkage Model,"Lam, David;Van Crey, Nikko;Rouse, Elliott","Keywords: Wearable Robotics, Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Physically Assistive Devices","Abstract: The stiffness of passive lower-limb exoskeletons and orthoses governs their assistance. A common practice in the design of these systems is to assume the stiffness of the device is determined only by the intended elastic element (e.g., spring), while the structural components, human attachments, and soft tissues are considered rigid. In practice, the mechanical behavior of orthoses is significantly affected by the compliance of these elements, which drastically impacts the assistance provided. In this work, we present a linkage model with compliant elements that can accurately predict the applied stiffness of ankle-foot orthoses, and retroactively estimate the stiffness of unintended spring elements from published data. The compliant model accurately predicted the torque trajectories of two published passive orthoses with modeled peak torques within 4% to 7% of measured values. In contrast, the rigid model greatly overestimated the peak torques, predicting 203% to 376% of the measured values. The compliant model also indicated that an onboard joint encoder could only measure 52% to 69% of the peak ankle angle recorded with motion capture. The compliant model was also used to reassess the stiffness range of a variable-stiffness orthosis, indicating that its adjustable range is likely 69% of rigid model predictions. Overall, this work highlights the need to consider how unmodeled compliance affects the mechanical behavior of orthoses and provides a foundation for further exploration.",,,,,,

While current prosthetic hand technologies can utilize forearm muscle data to achieve basic movements such as grasping, accurately estimating finger joint angles remains a significant challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Stage Cascade Convolutional Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory Network, where an upsampling module is introduced before the downsampling module to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we designed a transfer learning (TL) framework based on parameter freezing, where the pre-trained downsampling module is fixed, and only the upsampling module is updated with a small amount of out-of-distribution data to achieve TL. Furthermore, we compared the performance of unimodal and multimodal models, collecting surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, brightness mode ultrasound images (B-mode US images), and motion capture data simultaneously. The results show that on the validation set, the US image had the lowest error, while on the prediction set, the four-channel sEMG achieved the lowest error. The performance of the multimodal model in both datasets was intermediate between the unimodal models. On the prediction set, the average normalized root mean square error values for the four-channel sEMG, US images, and sensor fusion models across three subjects were 0.170, 0.203, and 0.186, respectively. By utilizing advanced sensor fusion techniques and TL, our approach can reduce the need for extensive data collection and training for new users, making prosthetic control more accessible and adaptable to individual needs.",,,,,,

However, prosthetic design often disregards compliance because of the additional complexity, weight, and needed control channels. This article focuses on designing a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) with weight, size, and performance compatible with prosthetic applications, addressing its implementation for the elbow joint. While a direct biomimetic approach suggests adopting an agonist-antagonist (AA) layout to replicate the biceps and triceps brachii with elastic actuation, this solution is not optimal to accommodate the varied morphologies of residual limbs. Instead, we employed the AA layout to craft an elbow prosthesis fully contained in the userÂ’s forearm, catering to individuals with distal transhumeral amputations. In addition, we introduce a variant of this design where the two motors are split in the upper arm and forearm to distribute mass and volume more evenly along the bionic limb, enhancing comfort for patients with more proximal amputation levels. We characterize and validate our approach, demonstrating that both architectures meet the target requirements for an elbow prosthesis. The system attains the desired 120â—?range of motion, achieves the target stiffness range of [2, 60] N ãƒ?m/rad, and can actively lift up to 3 kg. Our novel design reduces weight by up to 50% compared to existing VSAs for elbow prostheses while achieving performance comparable to the state of the art. Case studies suggest that passive and variable compliance could enable robust and safe interactions and task adaptability in the real world.",,,,,,

However, classical controllers are limited to few degrees of freedom (DoF). More recently, machine learning methods have been proposed to learn personalized controllers from user data. While promising, they often suffer from distribution shift during long-term usage, requiring costly model re-training. Moreover, most prosthetic sEMG sensors have low spatial density, which limits accuracy and the number of controllable motions. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing a novel myoelectric prosthetic system integrating a high density-sEMG (HD-sEMG) setup and incremental learning methods to accurately control 7 motions of the Hannes prosthesis. First, we present a newly designed, compact HD-sEMG interface equipped with 64 dry electrodes positioned over the forearm.

Additionally, EMG signals exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions, and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition, session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient session, including the use of the classifier for functional orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.",,,,,,

These tasks are challenging for robots due to the complexity and variability of the required actions. To tackle the difficulty of learning and executing long-horizon tasks, we propose a novel framework called the Multi-Head Skill Transformer (MuST). This model is designed to learn and sequentially chain together multiple motion primitives (skills), enabling robots to perform complex sequences of actions effectively. MuST introduces a ""progress value"" for each skill, guiding the robot on which skill to execute next and ensuring smooth transitions between skills. Additionally, our model is capable of expanding its skill set and managing various sequences of sub-tasks efficiently. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that MuST significantly enhances the robot's ability to perform long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks.

However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating a sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description.

Manipulation 4,Adaptive Contact-Rich Manipulation through Few-Shot Imitation Learning with Force-Torque Feedback and Pre-Trained Object Representations,"Tsuji, Chikaha;Coronado, Enrique;Osorio, Pablo;Venture, Gentiane","Keywords: Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Force Control","Abstract: Imitation learning offers a pathway for robots to perform repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more engaging and meaningful activities. However, challenges arise from the need for extensive demonstrations and the disparity between training and real-world environments. This paper focuses on contact-rich tasks like wiping with soft and deformable objects, requiring adaptive force control to handle variations in wiping surface height and the sponge's physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates real-time force-torque (FT) feedback with pre-trained object representations. This approach allows robots to dynamically adjust to previously unseen changes in surface heights and sponges' physical properties. In real-world experiments, our method achieved 96% accuracy in applying the average reference force, significantly outperforming the previous method that lacked an FT feedback loop, which only achieved 4% accuracy. To evaluate the adaptability of our approach, we conducted experiments under different conditions from the training setup, involving 40 scenarios using 10 sponges with varying physical properties and 4 types of wiping surface heights, demonstrating significant improvements in the robot's adaptability by analyzing force trajectories.",,,,,,
Localization 2,GS-EVT: Cross-Modal Event Camera Tracking Based on Gaussian Splatting,"Liu, Tao;Yuan, Runze;Ju, Yiang;Xu, Xun;Yang, Jiaqi;Meng, Xiangting;Lagorce, Xavier;Kneip, Laurent","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Reliable self-localization is a foundational skill for many intelligent mobile platforms. This paper explores the use of event cameras for motion tracking thereby providing a solution with inherent robustness under difficult dynamics and illumination. In order to circumvent the challenge of event camera-based mapping, the solution is framed in a cross-modal way. It tracks a map representation that comes directly from frame-based cameras. Specifically, the proposed method operates on top of gaussian splatting, a state-of-the-art representation that permits highly efficient and realistic novel view synthesis. The key of our approach consists of a novel pose parametrization that uses a reference pose plus first order dynamics for local differential image rendering. The latter is then compared against images of integrated events in a staggered coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. As demonstrated by our results, the realistic view rendering ability of gaussian splatting leads to stable and accurate tracking across a variety of both publicly available and newly recorded data sequences.",,,,,,
Localization 2,A Coarse-To-Fine Event-Based Framework for Camera Pose Relocalization with Spatio-Temporal Retrieval and Refinement Network,"Song, Yuhang;Zhuang, Hao;Jiang, Junjie;Liu, Zuntao;Fang, Zheng","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Most existing event-based camera pose relocalization (CPR) learning methods implicitly encode environmental information into network parameters to achieve end-to-end mapping from event stream to pose. However, these end-to-end CPR methods fail to utilize prior environmental information effectively. As the scale of the environment increases, the difficulty of this mapping relationship grows significantly, reducing the robustness of the end-to-end methods across different scenarios. To address the above issues, this paper proposes the first coarse-to-fine event-based CPR framework, which achieves a new paradigm from end-to-end pose regression network to a hierarchical approach. In the coarse localization stage, we effectively encode similarity features by incorporating the fine-grained temporal information, achieving accurate retrieval of nearby event stream. In the pose refinement stage, we present an Event Spatio-temporal Pose Refinement Network (ESPR-Net) based on the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) architecture, which is capable of learning more nuanced spatio-temporal features to achieve accurate regression of the relative pose. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison on the IJRR and M3ED dataset, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both. Notably, our method attains a significant 83% performance improvement on the outdoor M3ED dataset.",,,,,,
Localization 2,Digital Beamforming Enhanced Radar Odometry,"Jiang, Jingqi;Xu, Shida;Zhang, Kaicheng;Wei, Jiyuan;Wang, Jingyang;Wang, Sen","Keywords: Localization, Mapping, SLAM","Abstract: Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in challenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip millimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention thanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low hardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems using traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer from limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the performance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing pipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it to 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal processing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically focus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring odometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems.

Following its remarkable achievements, global localization within NeRF maps is an essential task for enabling a wide range of applications. Recently, Loc-NeRF demonstrated a localization approach that combines traditional Monte Carlo Localization with NeRF, showing promising results for using NeRF as an environment map. However, despite its advancements, Loc-NeRF encounters the challenge of a time-intensive ray rendering process, which can be a significant limitation in practical applications. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Loc-NeRF, which enhances efficiency and accuracy in NeRF map-based global localization. We propose a particle rejection weighting strategy that estimates the uncertainty of particles by leveraging NeRFÂ’s inherent characteristics and incorporates them into the particle weighting process to reject abnormal particles. Additionally, Fast Loc-NeRF employs a coarse-to-fine approach, matching rendered pixels and observed images across multiple resolutions from low to high. As a result, it speeds up the costly particle update process while enhancing precise localization results. Our Fast Loc-NeRF establishes new state-of-the-art localization performance on several benchmarks, demonstrating both its accuracy and efficiency.",,,,,,

Most of these algorithms have predominantly been validated in open outdoor environments; however, they often encounter challenges in confined indoor settings. In such indoor environments, reliable point cloud registration becomes problematic due to the rapid changes in LiDAR scans and repetitive structural features like walls and stairs, particularly in multifloor buildings. In this paper, we present NV-LIOM, a normal vector-based LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping framework focused on robust point cloud registration designed for indoor multifloor environments. Our approach extracts the normal vectors from the LiDAR scans and utilizes them for correspondence search to enhance the point cloud registration performance. To ensure robust registration, the distribution of the normal vector directions is analyzed, and situations of degeneracy are examined to adjust the matching uncertainty. Additionally, a viewpoint-based loop closure module is implemented to avoid wrong correspondences that are blocked by the walls. The proposed method is tested through public datasets and our own dataset. To contribute to the community, the code will be made public on https://github.com/dhchung/nv_liom.",,,,,,

Two commonly used radar types are spinning radars and phased-array radars, each offering distinct sensor characteristics. Existing datasets typically feature only a single type of radar, leading to the development of algorithms limited to that specific kind. In this work, we highlight that combining different radar types offers complementary advantages, which can be leveraged through a heterogeneous radar dataset. Moreover, this new dataset fosters research in multi-session and multi-robot scenarios where robots are equipped with different types of radars.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in Î¼s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations.

Place Recognition 2,ZeroSCD: Zero-Shot Street Scene Change Detection,"Kannan, Shyam Sundar;Min, Byung-Cheol",Keywords: Mapping,"Abstract: Scene Change Detection is a challenging task in computer vision and robotics that aims to identify differences between two images of the same scene captured at different times. Traditional change detection methods rely on training models that take these image pairs as input and estimate the changes, which requires large amounts of annotated data, a costly and time-consuming process. To overcome this, we propose ZeroSCD, a zero-shot scene change detection framework that eliminates the need for training. ZeroSCD leverages pre-existing models for place recognition and semantic segmentation, utilizing their features and outputs to perform change detection. In this framework, features extracted from the place recognition model are used to estimate correspondences and detect changes between the two images. These are then combined with segmentation results from the semantic segmentation model to precisely delineate the boundaries of the detected changes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ZeroSCD outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection accuracy, despite not being trained on any of the benchmark datasets, proving its effectiveness and adaptability across different scenarios.",,,,,,

It encompasses global localization and place recognition, allowing a system to identify locations that have been mapped or visited before. Place recognition is commonly approached using cameras or LiDARs. However, these sensors are affected by bad weather or low lighting conditions. In this paper, we exploit automotive radars to address the problem of localizing a vehicle within a map using single radar scans. The effectiveness of radars is not dependent on environmental conditions, and they provide additional information not present in LiDARs such as Doppler velocity and radar cross section. However, the sparse and noisy radar measurement makes place recognition a challenge. Recent research in automotive radars addresses the sensor's limitations by aggregating multiple radar scans and using high-dimensional scene representations. We, in contrast, propose a novel neural network architecture that focuses on each point of single radar scans, without relying on an additional odometry input for scan aggregation. We extract pointwise local and global features, resulting in a compact scene descriptor vector. Our model improves local feature extraction by estimating the importance of each point for place recognition and enhances the global descriptor by leveraging the radar cross section information provided by the sensor. We evaluate our model using nuScenes and the 4DRadarDataset, which involve 2D and 3D automotive radar sensors. Our findings illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for single-scan place recognition using automotive radars.",,,,,,

Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from â‰?.8m to â‰?.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from â‰?1% to â‰?5%.

Tactile Sensing and Manipulation,Shared Control for Cable Routing with Tactile Sensing,"Bao, Ange;Zheng, Haoran;Shi, Xiaohang;Zhao, Pei","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Dexterous Manipulation, Force and Tactile Sensing","Abstract: Multi-stage deformable linear object manipulation, such as cable routing, is the common and necessary part of human life and industry. However, autonomous robots still lack the dexterity and generalization required for these complex tasks. Direct teleoperation is an alternative approach, but the absence of reliable force and haptic feedback methods undermines its robustness and efficiency. This paper proposes a shared control method based on tactile sensing to address a multi-stage, contact-rich cable routing task. The proposed method allows human and robotic autonomy to share control of the robot platform. An action primitive vocabulary is constructed, incorporating adaptive authority allocation between human and autonomy, to generate motions for specific task stages. These allocations modulate the control weights of human and autonomy in accordance with the requirements of task stages. The method selects primitives from this vocabulary based on the tactile data and human intention. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a task involving straightening a cable and slotting it into a clip. We compare its performance with alternative methods and present that our method has a higher success rate and takes less time than direct teleoperation.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing and Manipulation,Whisker-Based Active Tactile Perception for Contour Reconstruction,"Dang, Yixuan;Xu, Qinyang;Zhang, Yu;Yao, Xiangtong;Zhang, Liding;Bing, Zhenshan;Roehrbein, Florian;Knoll, Alois","Keywords: Biologically-Inspired Robots, Force and Tactile Sensing, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces of three different objects.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing and Manipulation,CDM: Contact Diffusion Model for Multi-Contact Point Localization,"Han, Seo Wook;Kim, Min Jun","Keywords: Physical Human-Robot Interaction, Probabilistic Inference","Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Contact Diffusion Model (CDM), a novel learning-based approach for multi-contact point localization. We consider a robot equipped with joint torque sensors and a force/torque sensor at the base. By leveraging a diffusion model, CDM addresses the singularity where multiple pairs of contact points and forces produce identical sensor measurements. We formulate CDM to be conditioned on past model outputs to account for the time-dependent characteristics of the multi-contact scenarios. Moreover, to effectively address the complex shape of the robot surfaces, we incorporate the signed distance field in the denoising process. Consequently, CDM can localize contacts at arbitrary locations with high accuracy. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, CDM operates at 15.97ms and, in the real world, achieves an error of 0.44cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24cm in dual-contact scenarios.",,,,,,

Most of the literature considers the rigid co-grasping of non-deformable items in which both the human and the robot directly hold the transported object with their hands. In this paper, we implement a control strategy for the collaborative manipulation of a cable-suspended platform. The latter is an articulated and partially deformable object that can be used as a base where to place the transported object. In this way, the human and the robot are not rigidly coupled, ensuring a greater flexibility in the partners' motions and a safer interaction. However, the uncertain dynamics of the platform introduces a greater possibility of unintended collisions with external objects, which must be distinguished from contacts arising when a load is placed on or removed from the platform.

Particularly in scenarios where the cost of failure is high, remote human teleoperation can be the preferred method of robot control due to the adaptability and high-level decision making of humans. Teleoperation brings many challenges including lack of accurate prior knowledge about the environment, limited views of the environment by on-board sensors, and especially inconsistent latency. 7-DOF (degrees of freedom) manipulators provide redundancy which can be utilized for increased flexibility in manipulation, and may be preferred to 6-DOF manipulators in many scenarios. The redundancy, however, must be considered by the teleoperation system. We present an extension to an existing Interactive Planning and Supervised Execution (IPSE) system that enables full teleoperation of a 7-DOF robot by encoding the redundant degree of freedom with a Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, which is user-manipulable via an SEW angle graph.

In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n=30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method.

To address this, we propose a representation learning method, Multi-modal Joint Predictive Representation (MJPR), which utilizes multi-modal interactive information to predict future latent states. The joint prediction method achieves the representation training for modalities and promotes each modality to generate complementary information related to predictions of each other. In addition, we introduce multi-modal loss balancing to prompt training equilibrium and cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) to align the modalities for effective modal interaction. We establish the multi-modal environments in the Deepmind Control suite (DMC) and Webots and compare our method with current RL representation methods. Experimental results show that MJPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 12.0% on six subtasks in DMC environments. It outperforms advanced methods by 16.7% and 55.4% in simple tasks and complex tasks of Webots environment, respectively. Moreover, ablation experiments are established in the DMC environment to verify the importance of each module to MJPR.",,,,,,
Reinforcement Learning 4,FLEX: A Framework for Learning Robot-Agnostic Force-Based Skills Involving Sustained Contact Object Manipulation,"Fang, Shijie;Gao, Wenchang;Goel, Shivam;Thierauf, Christopher;Scheutz, Matthias;Sinapov, Jivko","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving sustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g., drawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in textit{force space}, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamicsÂ—such as joint configurationsÂ—allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting. Link: url{https://tufts-ai-robotics-group.github.io/FLEX/}",,,,,,

However, collecting preferences for the adaptation process in robotics is often challenging and time-consuming. In this work we explore the adaptation of pre-trained robots in the low-preference-data regime. We show that, in this regime, recent adaptation approaches suffer from catastrophic reward forgetting (CRF), where the updated reward model overfits to the new preferences, leading the agent to become unable to perform the original task. To mitigate CRF, we propose to enhance the original reward model with a small number of parameters (low-rank matrices) responsible for modeling the preference adaptation. Our evaluation shows that our method can efficiently and effectively adjust robotic behavior to human preferences across simulation benchmark tasks and multiple real-world robotic tasks.

Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose Goal-Contrastive Rewards (GCR), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task.",,,,,,

In this work, we present a novel RL-based pipeline equipped with variable impedance control and motion adaptation leveraging observation history for generalizable articulated object manipulation, focusing on smooth and dexterous motion during zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. To mitigate the sim-to-real gap, our pipeline diminishes reliance on vision by not leveraging the vision data feature (RGBD/pointcloud) directly as policy input but rather extracting useful low-dimensional data first via off-the-shelf modules. Additionally, we experience less sim-to-real gap by inferring object motion and its intrinsic properties via observation history as well as utilizing impedance control both in the simulation and in the real world. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed training setting with great randomization and a specialized reward system (task-aware and motion-aware) that enables multi-staged, end-to-end manipulation without heuristic motion planning.

Reinforcement Learning 4,From Imitation to Refinement -- Residual RL for Precise Assembly,"Ankile, Lars;Simeonov, Anthony;Shenfeld, Idan;Torne Villasevil, Marcel;Agrawal, Pulkit","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Learning from Demonstration, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have made it easy to teach robots new tasks. However, we find that the ease of teaching comes at the cost of unreliable performance that saturates with increasing data for tasks requiring precision. The performance saturation can be attributed to two critical factors: (a) distribution shift resulting from the use of offline data and (b) the lack of closed-loop corrective control caused by action chucking (predicting a set of future actions executed open-loop) critical for BC performance.
Our key insight is that by predicting action chunks, BC policies function more like trajectory ""planners"" than closed-loop controllers necessary for reliable execution. To address these challenges, we devise a simple yet effective method, ResiP (Residual for Precise Manipulation), that overcomes the reliability problem while retaining BCÂ’s ease of teaching and long-horizon capabilities. ResiP augments a frozen, chunked BC model with a fully closed-loop residual policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses distribution shifts and introduces closed-loop corrections over open-loop execution of action chunks predicted by the BC trajectory planner.",,,,,,
Imitation Learning 1,Fast Policy Synthesis with Variable Noise Diffusion Models,"HÃ¸eg, Sigmund Hennum;Du, Yilun;Egeland, Olav","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Learning from Demonstration, AI-Based Methods","Abstract: Diffusion models have seen rapid adoption in robotic imitation learning, enabling autonomous execution of complex dexterous tasks. However, action synthesis is often slow, requiring many steps of iterative denoising, limiting the extent to which models can be used in tasks that require fast reactive policies. To sidestep this, recent works have explored how the distillation of the diffusion process can be used to accelerate policy synthesis. However, distillation is computationally expensive and can hurt both the accuracy and diversity of synthesized actions. We propose SDP (Streaming Diffusion Policy), an alternative method to accelerate policy synthesis, leveraging the insight that generating a partially denoised action trajectory is substantially faster than a full output action trajectory. At each observation, our approach outputs a partially denoised action trajectory
with variable levels of noise corruption
, where the immediate action to execute is noise-free, with subsequent actions having increasing levels of noise and uncertainty. The partially denoised action trajectory for a new observation can then be quickly generated by applying a few steps of denoising to the previously predicted noisy action trajectory (rolled over by one timestep). We illustrate the efficacy of this approach, dramatically speeding up policy synthesis while preserving performance across both simulated and real-world settings.

Yet compliance is often overlooked by today's visuomotor policies that solely focus on position control. This paper introduces Adaptive Compliance Policy (ACP), a novel framework that learns to dynamically adjust system compliance both spatially and temporally for given manipulation tasks from human demonstrations, improving upon previous approaches that rely on pre-selected compliance parameters or assume uniform constant stiffness. However, computing full compliance parameters from human demonstrations is an ill-defined problem. Instead, we estimate an approximate compliance profile with two useful properties: avoiding large contact forces and encouraging accurate tracking. Our approach enables robots to handle complex contact-rich manipulation tasks and achieves over 50% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art visuomotor policy methods.",,,,,,

Imitation Learning 1,Diff-DAgger: Uncertainty Estimation with Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation,"Lee, Sung-Wook;Kang, Xuhui;Kuo, Yen-Ling","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Learning from Demonstration","Abstract: Recently, diffusion policy has shown impressive results in handling multi-modal tasks in robotic manipulation. However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8.

Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks.

Traditionally, positioning errors in industrial robots have been corrected statically by determining pose-dependent stiffness values. However, recent numerical models incorpÃ³rate inertial effects to improve positioning error correction, making accurate inertial parameter identification essential. These parameters are typically unknown and must be determined experimentally. While methodologies for inertial parameter estimation have been extensively studied, none have accounted for the effect of the counterbalance system in this process.

Particularly collisions at high speed can severely damage the drivetrains and joint bearings of robots. In order to avoid such collisions, path planners exist that adapt the robotÂ’s original trajectory online if a collision hazard is detected. These methods require additional sensors such as cameras, are computationally costly and never flawless due to occlusions. Another approach is to incorporate a cost function that promotes collision tolerance while planning the initial trajectory. The resulting impact-aware path plan minimizes the chance of robot hardware damage if a collision would occur. Two algorithms are presented to assess collision tolerance in high-speed robots, taking into account factors such as robot pose, impact direction, and maximum intermittent loading of the gearboxes and bearings.

Then, dynamic points can be effectively removed by the Doppler criteria, deriving more consistent geometric observations. FMCW-LIO eventually achieves accurate state estimation and static mapping, even in structure-degenerated environments. Extensive experiments in diverse scenes are performed and FMCW-LIO outperforms other algorithms on both accuracy and robustness.",,,,,,
SLAM 3,Submodular Optimization for Keyframe Selection & Usage in SLAM,"Thorne, David;Chan, Nathan;Ma, Yanlong;Robison, Christopher, Christa;Osteen, Philip;Lopez, Brett","Keywords: SLAM, Optimization and Optimal Control, Field Robots","Abstract: Keyframes are LiDAR scans saved for future reference in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), but despite their central importance most algorithms leave choices of which scans to save and how to use them to wasteful heuristics. This work proposes two novel keyframe selection strategies for localization and map summarization, as well as a novel approach to submap generation which selects keyframes that best constrain localization. Our results show that online keyframe identification and submap generation reduce the number of saved keyframes and improve per scan computation time without compromising localization performance.

SLAM 3,Equivariant Filter Design for Range-Only SLAM,"Ge, Yixiao;Pearce, Arthur;van Goor, Pieter;Mahony, Robert","Keywords: SLAM, Range Sensing, Mapping","Abstract: Range-only Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (RO-SLAM) is of interest in the robotics community due to its practical applications; for example, ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation in terrestrial and aerial applications and acoustic beacon localisation in marine applications. In this work, we consider a mobile robot equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a range sensor that measures distances to a collection of fixed landmarks. We derive an equivariant filter (EqF) for the RO-SLAM problem based on a symmetry Lie group that is compatible with the range measurements. The proposed filter does not require bootstrapping or initialisation of landmark positions, and demonstrates robustness to the no-prior situation. The filter is demonstrated on a real-world dataset, and it is shown to significantly outperform a state-of-the-art EKF alternative in terms of both accuracy and robustness.",,,,,,
SLAM 3,Toward Globally Optimal State Estimation Using Automatically Tightened Semidefinite Relaxations,"DÃ¼mbgen, Frederike;Holmes, Connor;Agro, Ben;Barfoot, Timothy","Keywords: Optimization and Optimal Control, Localization, Robot Safety, Global Optimality","Abstract: In recent years, semidefinite relaxations of common optimization problems in robotics have attracted growing attention due to their ability to provide globally optimal solutions. In many cases, it was shown that specific handcrafted redundant constraints are required to obtain tight relaxations, and thus global optimality. These constraints are formulation-dependent and typically identified through a lengthy manual process. Instead, the present article suggests an automatic method to find a set of sufficient redundant constraints to obtain tightness, if they exist. We first propose an efficient feasibility check to determine if a given set of variables can lead to a tight formulation. Second, we show how to scale the method to problems of bigger size. At no point of the process do we have to find redundant constraints manually. We showcase the effectiveness of the approach, in simulation and on real datasets, for range-based localization and stereo-based pose estimation. We also reproduce semidefinite relaxations presented in recent literature and show that our automatic method always finds a smaller set of constraints sufficient for tightness than previously considered.",,,,,,
SLAM 3,Viewpoint-Aware Visibility Scoring for Point Cloud Registration in Loop Closure,"Yoon, Ilseung;Islam, Tariq;Kim, Kwangrok;Kwon, Cheolhyeon","Keywords: SLAM, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Mapping","Abstract: AbstractÂ—Lidar-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) encounters a substantial challenge in the form of accumulating errors, which can adversely impact its reliability. Loop closing techniques have been extensively employed to counteract this issue. Nonetheless, the loop closing conundrum remains difficult to resolve, as point clouds often exhibit partial overlap due to disparities in scanning pose (viewpoints). This renders the conventional point cloud registration such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm problematic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a two-stage viewpoint-aware point cloud registration technique that assigns suitable weights to the correspondence pairs associating two point clouds from different viewpoints. The weights account for the visibility of points from their respective viewpoint as well as from the viewpoint of the counterpart point cloud, making the registration more relying on commonly visible points from the both viewpoints. Experimental results, utilizing the KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay dataset, indicate that the proposed technique delivers more precise and robust performance compared to the baseline techniques.",,,,,,
Mechanism Design 1,Tension Dependent Twisted String Actuator Modelling and Efficacy Benchmarking in Force and Impedance Control,"Herneth, Christopher;Cheng, Yi;Ganguly, Amartya;Haddadin, Sami","Keywords: Actuation and Joint Mechanisms, Force Control, Tendon/Wire Mechanism","Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of Twisted String Actuators (TSA), focused on enhancing contraction modelling accuracy and establishing a baseline for TSA tension and impedance control efficacy. A novel TSA string radius function is introduced, computing effective radii for multi-strand bundles based on axial actuator tension. The proposed model was validated in physical experiments, resulting in a reduction of maximal errors between measured and simulated actuator contraction trajectories from up to 60% in established models to around 10% in our work. Additionally, the tension-dependent radius modification effectively reduced errors between the estimated and the measured bundle tension by an order of magnitude, marking an essential step towards TSA control independent of bundle tension measurements. TSA tension control was assessed based on four metrics: accuracy, precision, impact stability, and bandwidth, following ISO 9283:1998 standards. The quality of tension control was found to be dependent on bundle tension, twisting angle and strand quantity, whereas impact stability was maintained in all configurations. Joint impedance control with TSA was evaluated for perturbation stability and position control bandwidth, where the latter was enhanced with increasing joint stiffness. The presented analysis informs designers about the capabilities of TSAs in different configurations, and their respective suitability for desired applications.",,,,,,

Relative to traditional hydraulic and pneumatic systems in robotics, TSAs are compact and lightweight but face limitations in stroke length and force-transmission ratios. Our integrated TSA-winch system overcomes these constraints by providing variable transmission ratios through dynamic adjustment. It increases actuator stroke by winching instead of overtwisting, and it improves force output by twisting. The design features a rotating turret that houses a winch, which is mounted on a bevel gear assembly driven by a through-hole drive shaft. Mathematical models are developed for the combined displacement and velocity control of this system. Experimental validation demonstrates the actuator's ability to achieve a wide range of transmission ratios and precise movement control.

Mechanism Design 1,Design and Evaluation of High-Performance Motion-Decoupled Cable Transmission Modules,"Takei, Ryo;Frishman, Samuel;Whitney, John Peter","Keywords: Tendon/Wire Mechanism, Actuation and Joint Mechanisms, Medical Robots and Systems","Abstract: Cable transmissions are commonly used in robotics for remote force transmission, offering a lightweight, compact, and efficient solution for transmitting high forces between input and output. However, cables in flexible compression housings (Bowden cables), exhibit high static friction, which increases exponentially with total bend angle. Alternatively, internally routed ball-bearing supported cable capstan transmissions are low friction, but complex and present challenges in routing multiple sets of cables. In this paper, we propose motion-decoupled cable transmission modules that address these challenges, occupying the middle ground, functioning as discrete-joint ball-bearing supported Bowden cables. Our rolling-plus-twist joint design decouples pairs of routed cables from changing significantly in tension, length, or friction during large angle motion of the linked transmission. Using sub-1 mm diameter high-strength synthetic cable, the transmission exhibits a maximum coupling motion of only 0.15 mm over the full range of motion of the cable-transmission mechanism, approximately 10% of pretension in combined hysteresis and friction, a transmission stiffness of 10 N/mm, weighing just 9 g per rolling joint and 5 g per twist joint. Two applications are demonstrated: cable routing alongside a robot arm for, say, gripper remote actuation, and remote needle advancement for an MRI-safe needle biopsy robot.",,,,,,

To enhance environmental adaptability and prevent physical damage, the wrist can operate in a low-stiffness mode. However, the flexibility of this mode might negatively impact stable and precise manipulation. To address this, we proposed a robotic wrist that switches between a passive low-stiffness mode for environmental adaptation and an active high-stiffness mode for precise manipulation.

Compared with VOD in generic scenes, the lower contrast and smaller color space of microscopy imaging further introduce feature overlap between the foreground objects and the background objects (e.g., impurity cells and contaminants). Transformer-based methods have achieved great success in the VOD of generic scenes by utilizing object queries to model the inner-frame objects and the inter-frame objects. However, the appearance overlap problem in microscopy video frames significantly compromises the inter-frame query aggregation by introducing background features into the object query. To tackle this challenge, this paper reports a static-dynamic query-based VOD network that treats object queries of the current video frame and reference video frames differently. Specifically, a two-stage framework is implemented that first generates high-quality object queries of reference frames with a static Transformer decoder pre-trained on a still image dataset. The network is then trained on a per-frame annotated dataset using a dynamic Transformer decoder to model the object queries of the current frame. A Reference Query Relation Module is further proposed to enhance the reference queries for more effective aggregation with the current query. Experiments on clinically collected biopsied sperm datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",,,,,,

Traditional stitching methods perform well in small single-unit vehicles with stable camera poses. However, the stitching quality sharply degrades when applied to large tractor-trailers due to the continuous pose changes caused by the non-rigid connection between the tractor and trailer. In detail, first, the extended length of tractor-trailers results in low overlap between cameras, making feature extraction and matching challenging. Additionally, the stitched images often appear irregular, detracting from visual quality. Besides, even if static stitching looks natural, it causes jitter in dynamic scenarios due to random feature extraction. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep stitching method for tractortrailer surround view system. We introduce a feature extraction module for tractor-trailer scenarios (FMT) to enhance feature extraction in low-overlap situations. Besides, we design a spatiotemporally consistent control point constraint strategy (STCC) to achieve spatial shape preservation and temporal smoothing effects, resulting in visually consistent and stable stitched sequences. Experimental results from both public and real dataset show that our method efficiently completes tractortrailer surround view stitching, producing well-aligned and natural panoramic images compared to previous methods.",,,,,,

Such requirement can cause rotor saturation, because the rotor thrust enlarged for interaction force may leave a reduced margin for attitude stabilization. We first design an H -shaped coaxial tiltrotor that can generate a sufficiently large interaction force than a conventional multirotor. We then propose an overall framework composed of high-level robust controller and low-level control allocation for the coaxial tiltrotor to ensure robustness against uncertain motion of the unknown interacting object and to overcome the saturation issue. To guarantee the robustness at all time, we design a controller based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB). Then, we formulate a problem of computing low-level actuator inputs avoiding rotor saturation as a tractable nonlinear optimization problem, which can be solved real-time. The proposed framework is validated in extensive real-world experiments where the 3.3 kg tiltrotor successfully pushes a cart weighing up to 60 kg. An ablation study with the tiltrotor shows effectiveness of the proposed control allocation law in avoiding rotor saturation. Furthermore, a comparative experiment with a conventional multirotor shows failure in the same setting, which validates the use of the coaxial tiltrotor.

FLAF is built on a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT&R) framework, which supports robotic applications by teaching robots to cruise various paths that fulfill many daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failures in feature-based Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM), particularly in textureless regions common in human-made environments, poses a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of VT&R. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based VSLAM system, creating an active VT&R solution that mitigates tracking failures. Our system features a Pan-Tilt Unit (PTU)-based active mounted on a mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM (AC-SLAM) operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeating phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF actively directs the camera toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points while following the learned trajectory.

Marine Robotics 3,Shape BoW: Generalized Bag of Words for Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection in Bathymetric SLAM,"Zhang, Qianyi;Kim, Jinwhan","Keywords: Marine Robotics, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, SLAM","Abstract: Existing bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods predominantly rely on odometry information for loop closure detection, which has a deteriorating performance when handling unreliable odometry data or conducting large-scale mapping missions. This letter introduces a novel generalized Bag of Words (BoW) named Shape BoW (S-BoW) for appearance-based loop closure detection in bathymetric SLAM. S-BoW is trained from the collection of the terrain gradient features extracted from existing bathymetric datasets and can be used in various bathymetric scenarios. We integrated the loop closure detection method using S-BoW into a feature-based bathymetric SLAM method called TTT SLAM, and we evaluated its performance against three existing bathymetric SLAM methods using two datasets. The results indicate that S-BoW not only serves as a generalized BoW but also enhances the efficiency of the integrated SLAM method, achieving accuracy comparable to the original TTT SLAM while offering a 37% speed improvement in a large-scale sea trial dataset. To the best of our knowledge, S-BoW is the first generalized BoW that can be used to realize effective appearance-based loop closure detection in bathymetric SLAM.",,,,,,

Given the array of utilities derived from oysters, the application of autonomous robotic systems for oyster detection and monitoring grows increasingly relevant. However, current monitoring strategies for assessing oyster assemblages are mostly destructive. While manually identifying and monitoring oysters from video footage is nondestructive, is it tedious and requires expert input.
An alternative to human monitoring is deploying trained object detection models on edge devices, such as the Aqua2 robot, to enable real-time monitoring of oysters directly in the field. Yet training these models to maximum efficacy requires an extensive dataset that accurately represents the domain, and it is difficult to obtain such high-quality training data due to the complications inherent to underwater environments. To address these complications, we introduce a novel method leveraging stable diffusion to generate high-quality synthetic data for the marine domain. We exploit diffusion models to create photorealistic oyster imagery, using ControlNet inputs to ensure consistency with the segmentation ground-truth mask, the geometry of the scene, and the target domain of real oyster images. This large dataset is used to train a vision model, specifically based on YOLOv10. The trained model is then deployed and tested on an edge platform, the Aqua2, in an underwater robotics system. We achieve state-of-the-art (0.657 mAP@50) for oyster detection, which can pave the way for autonomous oyster habitat monitoring and increase the efficiency of on-bottom oyster aquaculture",,,,,,

Specifically, IBURD generates both images of underwater debris and their pixel-level annotations, using source images of debris objects, their annotations, and target background images of marine environments. With Poisson editing and style transfer techniques, IBURD is even able to robustly blend transparent objects into arbitrary backgrounds and automatically adjust the style of blended images using the blurriness metric of target background images. These generated images of marine debris in actual underwater backgrounds address the data scarcity and data variety problems faced by deep-learned vision algorithms in challenging underwater conditions, and can enable the use of AUVs for environmental cleanup missions.

Because of the absence of absolute positioning underwater, these tasks strongly rely on embedded sensors, including proprioceptive or navigation sensors Â— which can be fused for an odometry, Â— and exteroceptive sensors. One of the most popular exteroceptive sensors for underwater is the imaging sonar, which emits a large fan-shaped acoustic signal and estimates the position of the surrounding obstacles from a measure of the reflected signal. This paper addresses underwater online localization and 3D mapping using a forward looking, wide-aperture imaging sonar and vehicleÂ’s intrinsic navigation estimates. We introduce 3DSSDF (3D Sonar Reconstruction Using Signed Distance Functions), a new localization and 3D mapping algorithm based on signed distance functions, which is evaluated in simulation and on real data, in man-made and natural environments. Comparisons to reference trajectories and maps demonstrate that, in our tests, 3DSSDF efficiently corrects navigation drift and that trajectory and map accuracy is always below 1 m and below 1% of the distanced travelled, which can be sufficient for the safe inspection of natural or artificial underwater structures.",,,,,,

It tackles the problem of intermediate state estimation when external localization is unavailable or in the event of a sensor outage. The proposed observer comprises two nonlinear observers based on a recently developed iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) algorithm. It takes the inputs via an IMU preintegration model where the first observer is a quaternion-based IPG. The output for the first observer is the input for the second observer, estimating the velocity and, consequently, the position. The proposed observer is validated on a public underwater dataset and a real-world experiment using our robot platform.

In dynamic underwater environments, such as in aquaculture operations, the robots are additionally expected to deal with state and motion uncertainty and errors, dynamic and deformable obstacles, currents, and disturbances. Previous work has introduced real-time frameworks that provided safe navigation in cluttered environments, active perception in static environments, and robust navigation in uncertain dynamic environments. This paper introduces a new real-time approach called ResiVis, which leverages the best aspects of the aforementioned techniques along with a new formulation that further enhances underwater autonomy by enabling active perception of static and dynamic target objects from desired distances. The proposed method utilizes path-optimization for real-time response with constraints guaranteeing continuous collision safety, and computes paths with clearance adaptive to both the conditions of the environments and the performance of the path follower. An improved new constraint encourages observations of dynamic objects with the planner adapting to satisfy desired observation distances and their projected future positions. ResiVis is validated with challenging simulation experiments and with hardware-in-the-loop trials in real industrial-scale aquaculture facilities.",,,,,,
Planinng and Control for Legged Robots 1,Energy-Optimal Asymmetrical Gait Selection for Quadrupedal Robots,"Alqaham, Yasser G.;Cheng, Jing;Gan, Zhenyu","Keywords: Legged Robots, Optimization and Optimal Control, Dynamics","Abstract: Symmetrical gaits, such as trotting, are com- monly employed in quadrupedal robots for their simplicity and stability. However, the potential of asymmetrical gaits, such as bounding and gallopingÂ—which are prevalent in their natural counterparts at high speeds or over long distancesÂ—is less clear in the design of locomotion controllers for legged machines. In these asymmetrical gaits, the system dynamics are more complex because the front and rear leg pairs exhibit different motions, which are coupled by the rotational motion of the torso. This study systematically examines five distinct asymmetrical quadrupedal gaits on a legged robot, aiming to uncover the fundamental differences in footfall sequences and the consequent energetics across a broad range of speeds. Utilizing a full-body model of a quadrupedal robot (Unitree A1), we developed a hybrid system for each gait, incorporating the desired footfall sequence and rigid impacts. To identify the most energy-optimal gait, we applied optimal control methods, framing it as a trajectory optimization problem with specific constraints and a work-based cost of transport as an objective function. Our results show that, in the context of asymmetrical gaits, when minimizing cost of transport across the entire stride, the front leg pair primarily propels the system forward, while the rear leg pair acts more like an inverted pendulum, contributing significantly less to the energetic output. Addi- tionally, while boundingÂ—characterized by two aerial phases per cycleÂ—is the most energy-optimal gait at higher speeds, the energy expenditure of gaits at speeds below 1 m/s depend heavily on the robotÂ’s specific design.",,,,,,

Traditional approaches in legged robots often employ series elastic actuators (SEA) with discrete rigid components, which, while effective, add weight and complexity. This paper presents an innovative alternative by integrating continuously compliant structures into the lower legs of a bipedal robot, fundamentally transforming the SEA concept. Our approach replaces traditional rigid segments with lightweight, deformable materials, reducing overall mass and simplifying the actuation design. This novel design introduces unique challenges in modeling, sensing, and control, due to the infinite dimensionality of continuously compliant elements.

It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.",,,,,,

Traditional MDTSP overlooks practical constraints like limited battery level and inter-agent conflicts, often leading to infeasible or unsafe solutions in reality. In this work, we incorporate energy and resource consumption constraints to form the Constrained MDTSP (CMDTSP). We design a novel hierarchical framework to obtain high-quality solutions with low computational complexity. The framework decomposes a given CMDTSP instance into manageable sub-problems, each handled individually via a TSP solver and heuristic search to generate tours.

An outstanding challenge with simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework, CaDRE, to generate realistic, diverse, and controllable safety-critical scenarios. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world scenarios, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning (RL) and sampling-based methods.",,,,,,
Safe Control 1,Certificated Actor-Critic: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Control Barrier Functions for Safe Navigation,"Xie, Junjun;Zhao, Shuhao;Hu, Liang;Gao, Huijun","Keywords: Robot Safety, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a prominent approach to designing safe navigation systems of robots. Despite their popularity, current CBF-based methods exhibit some limitations: optimization-based safe control techniques tend to be either myopic or computationally intensive, and they rely on simplified system models; conversely, the learning-based methods suffer from the lack of quantitative indication in terms of navigation performance and safety. In this paper, we present a new model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Certificated Actor-Critic (CAC), which introduces a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and well-defined reward functions derived from CBFs. We carry out theoretical analysis and proof of our algorithm, and propose several improvements in algorithm implementation.

Safe Control 1,Exact Imposition of Safety Boundary Conditions in Neural Reachable Tubes,"Singh, Aditya;Feng, Zeyuan;Bansal, Somil","Keywords: Robot Safety, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely adopted verification tool to provide safety and performance guarantees for autonomous systems. However, it involves solving a partial differential equation (PDE) to compute a safety value function, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making its direct application to large-scale systems intractable. To overcome these challenges, DeepReach,a recently proposed learning-based approach, approximates high-dimensional reachable tubes using neural networks (NNs). While shown to be effective, the accuracy of the learned solution decreases with system complexity. One of the reasons for this degradation is a soft imposition of safety constraints during the learning process, which corresponds to the boundary conditions of the PDE, resulting in inaccurate value functions. In this work, we propose ExactBC, a variant of DeepReach that imposes safety constraints exactly during the learning process by restructuring the overall value function as a weighted sum of the boundary condition and the NN output. Moreover, the proposed variant no longer needs a boundary loss term during the training process, thus eliminating the need to balance different loss terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in significantly improving the accuracy of the learned value function for four challenging reachability tasks: a rimless wheel system with state resets, collision avoidance in a cluttered environment, autonomous rocket landing, and multi-aircraft collision avoidance.",,,,,,

Traditional reliability assessment methods fall short in addressing the complexities of these systems, particularly when dealing with black-box or dynamically changing control policies. The traditional approaches are applied manually and do not consider frequent software updates. In this paper, we present RelAIBotiX, a new methodology that enables dynamic and continuous reliability assessment, specifically tailored for robotic systems controlled by AI-Algorithms. RelAIBotiX is a dynamic reliability assessment framework that combines four methods: (i) Skill Detection that automatically identifies executed skills using deep learning techniques, (ii) Behavioral Analysis that creates an operational profile of the robotic system containing information about the skill execution sequence, active components for each skill, and their utilization intensity that influence their failure rate, (iii) Reliability Model Generation that automatically transforms the operational profile and reliability data of robotic hardware components into quantitative hybrid reliability models, and (iv) Reliability Model Solver for the numerical evaluation of the generated reliability models. Our evaluation included computing the reliability of the system, the probability of failure of individual skills, and component sensitivity analysis.

Human-Robot Interaction 3,Adaptive Emotional Expression in Social Robots: A Multimodal Approach to Dynamic Emotion Modeling,"Park, Haeun;Lee, Jiyeon;Lee, Hui Sung","Keywords: Emotional Robotics, Gesture, Posture and Facial Expressions, Robot Companions","Abstract: Social robots have been extensively studied in recent decades, with many researchers exploring the use of modalities such as facial expressions to achieve more natural emotions in robots. Various methods have been attempted to generate and express robot emotions, including computational models that define an affect space and show dynamic emotion changes. However, the implementation of multimodal expression in previous models is ambiguous, and the generation of emotions in response to stimuli relies on heuristic methods. In this paper, we present a framework that enables robots to naturally express their emotions in a multimodal way, where the emotion can change over time based on the given stimulus values. By representing the robotÂ’s emotion as a position in an affect space of a computational emotion model, we consider the given stimuli values as driving forces that can shift the emotion position dynamically. In order to examine the feasibility of our proposed method, a mobile robot prototype was implemented that can recognize touch and express different emotions with facial expressions and movements. The experiment demonstrated that the emotion elicited by a given stimulus is contingent upon the robotÂ’s previous state, thereby imparting the impression that the robot possesses a distinctive emotion model. Furthermore, the Godspeed survey results indicated that our model was rated significantly higher than the baseline, which did not include a computational emotion model, in terms of anthropomorphism, animacy, and perceived intelligence. Notably, the unpredictabil ity of emotion switching contributed to a perception of greater lifelikeness, which in turn enhanced the overall interaction experience.",,,,,,

In such applications, the context for activating sensors and processing blocks required to accomplish a given task instance is usually manifested via multiple sensing modes. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel Commit-and-Switch (CAS) paradigm that simultaneously seeks to reduce both sensing and processing energy. In CAS, we first commit to a low-energy computational pipeline with a subset of available sensors. Then, the task context estimated by this pipeline is used to optionally switch to another energy-intensive DNN pipeline and activate additional sensors. We demonstrate how CASÂ’s paradigm of interweaving DNN computation and sensor triggering can be instantiated principally by constructing multi-head DNN models and jointly optimizing the accuracy and sensing costs associated with different heads. We exemplify CAS via the development of the RealGIN-MH model for multi-modal target acquisition tasks, a core enabler of immersive human-agent interaction.

This framework takes into account the interaction environment, and userÂ’s profile as well as emotional state. Two GPT models are used to generate responses. The initial one, named sensor-GPT, processes contextual data from the sensor along with the userÂ’s response and conversation history to create prompts for the second one, chat-GPT. These prompts can guide the model on how to integrate appropriate humor elements into the conversation, ensuring that the dialogue is both contextually relevant and humorous.

Human-Robot Interaction 3,UGotMe: An Embodied System for Affective Human-Robot Interaction,"Li, Peizhen;Cao, Longbing;Wu, Xiao-Ming;Yu, Xiaohan;Runze, Yang","Keywords: Social HRI, Gesture, Posture and Facial Expressions, Emotional Robotics","Abstract: Equipping humanoid robots with the capability to understand emotional states of human interactants and express emotions appropriately according to situations is essential for affective human-robot interaction. However, enabling current vision-aware multimodal emotion recognition models for affective human-robot interaction in the real-world raises embodiment challenges: addressing the environmental noise issue and meeting real-time requirements. First, in multiparty conversation scenarios, the noises inherited in the visual observation of the robot, which may come from either 1)distracting objects in the scene or 2) inactive speakers appearing in the field of view of the robot, hinder the models from extracting emotional cues from vision inputs. Secondly, realtime response, a desired feature for an interactive system, is also challenging to achieve. To tackle both challenges, we introduce an affective human-robot interaction system called UGotMe designed specifically for multiparty conversations. Two denoising strategies are proposed and incorporated into the system to solve the first issue. Specifically, to filter out distracting objects in the scene, we propose extracting face images of the speakers from the raw images and introduce a customized active face extraction strategy to rule out inactive speakers. As for the second issue, we employ efficient data transmission from the robot to the local server to improve realtime response capability. We deploy UGotMe on a human robot named Ameca to validate its real-time inference capabilities in practical scenarios.

The ability to adjust the level of compliance during operation has the potential to further improve the performance of these hands by enabling novel interaction strategies. However, achieving variable stiffness mechanically typically requires significant engineering complexity, making these systems difficult to manufacture, prone to error, and expensive. We present a novel, very simple mechanism for achieving variable stiffness. This mechanism employs tendon-driven antagonistic actuation, with Bowden cables connecting elastic elements to servomotors. It supports compact actuator designs, while the Bowden cables facilitate flexible component placement within a robotic system.

However, this grasping method has two significant limitations. First, the techniqueÂ’s effectiveness is reduced when interacting with topologically and geometrically simple objects like spheres, cubes, and cylinders, due to the inherent variability in grasping patterns. Additionally, the methodÂ’s low stiffness restricts its ability to securely handling heavier objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an entanglement soft robotic gripper with variable stiffness and two transformed grasping modes (entanglement and clamping modes). The gripper contains three filaments, which can enhance the stiffness through the mechanism of layer jamming. Furthermore, the entanglement mode and the clamping mode, can be transformed by adjusting the working length of the filaments. The grasping performance comparison with and without variable stiffness was carried out, and the results indicated that the implementation of variable stiffness led to a 149 % increase in payload weight. Through experimental validation, we successfully employed the gripper in variable stiffness and transformed modes to grasp items with various shapes and weights. Demonstration of grasping heavier objects and transforming between two grasping modes were also conducted to showcase the adaptability and versatility of the gripper.",,,,,,

In this work, we present SoftSpin, a system for dynamic spinning using a soft and compliant robotic hand. Unlike previous works that rely on quasi-static actions and precise object models, the proposed system learns to spin a pen through trial-and-error using only real-world data without requiring explicit prior knowledge of the penÂ’s physical attributes. With self-labeled trials sampled from the real world, the system discovers the set of pen grasping and spinning primitive parameters that enables a soft hand to spin the pen robustly and reliably. After 130 sampled actions, SoftSpin achieves 100 % success rate across three pens with different weights and weight distributions, demonstrating the systemÂ’s generalizability and robustness to changes in object properties. The results highlight the potential for soft robotic end-effectors to perform dynamic tasks including rapid in-hand manipulation.

Teleoperation and Human-Robot Interaction,A Comparative Study between a Virtual Wand and a One-To-One Approach for the Teleoperation of a Nearby Robotic Manipulator,"Poignant, Alexis;Morel, Guillaume;JarrassÃ©, Nathanael","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Physically Assistive Devices","Abstract: The prevailing and most effective approach to teleoperate a robotic arm involves a direct position-to-position mapping, imposing robotic end-effector movements that mirrors those of the user. However, due to this one-to-one mapping, the robot's motions are limited by the user's capability, particularly in translation. Drawing inspiration from head pointers utilized in the 1980s, originally designed to enable drawing with limited head motions for tetraplegic individuals, we proposed a ""virtual wand"" mapping which could be used by participants with reduced mobility. This mapping employs a virtual rigid linkage between the hand and the robot's end-effector. With this approach, rotations produce amplified translations through a lever arm, creating a ""rotation-to-position"" coupling and expanding the translation workspace at the expense of a reduced rotation space.
In this study, we compare the virtual wand approach to the one-to-one position mapping through the realization of 6-DoF reaching tasks. Results indicate that the two different mappings perform comparably well, are equally well-received by users, and exhibit similar motor control behaviors. Nevertheless, the virtual wand mapping is anticipated to outperform in tasks characterized by large translations and minimal effector rotations, whereas direct mapping is expected to demonstrate advantages in large rotations with minimal translations. These results pave the way for new interactions and interfaces, particularly in disability assistance utilizing residual body movements (instead of hands) as control input. Leveraging body parts with substantial rotations could enable the accomplishment of tasks previously deemed infeasible with standard direct coupling interfaces.",,,,,,

Teleoperation and Human-Robot Interaction,Stiffness Regulation Co-Pilot in Bilateral Teleimpedance Control: A Preliminary User Study,"Gomez Hernandez, Pedro;Jakobsen, Jonas Mariager;Pacchierotti, Claudio;Chinello, Francesco;Fang, Cheng","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Haptics and Haptic Interfaces, Physical Human-Robot Interaction","Abstract: Variable stiffness of a remote robot is crucial for a teleoperation system to deal with challenging tasks. External stiffness command interfaces have emerged as a promising solution to regulating the remote robot stiffness because of the benefits of their accuracy, ergonomics, and avoidance of the ""coupling effect"" that usually exists in muscle activity-based stiffness interfaces. However, the use of an external stiffness command interface requires good coordination between two limbs of an operator, which take care of the teleoperation task and the stiffness regulation task, respectively, at the same time, which is demanding for novice operators in dynamic situations necessitating agile and timely stiffness adjustments. In this paper, a new concept of Stiffness Regulation Co-pilot was proposed to facilitate the use of these interfaces. A co-pilot is a virtual agent that consists of a Stiffness Regulation Policy, which infers a reasonable stiffness regulation action from the task performance, and a feedback modality, which conveys the suggested stiffness regulation action to the operator. A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the co-pilot and the effect of different modalities of the co-pilot. The results showed that the cutaneous feedback or combined with another modality can potentially improve the task performance of the system and reduce the cognitive load of the operator compared to a teleoperation system without using the co-pilot.",,,,,,

Through introducing the event-triggered mechanism with the aim of reducing the network communication frequency in teleoperation system, the master and slave robots communicate with each other only when the triggering conditions are fulfilled, which enhances the efficiency of the network communication. This control strategy can guarantee the exponential convergence of the position synchronization tracking error of the master-slave robot end-effector. Moreover, the event-triggered conditions do not require any empirical design, but can be derived inversely with the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory. And the triggering time interval between two neighboring events is verified to be non-zero. It is demonstrated by utilizing the Lyapunov principle that the presented adaptive neural network control strategy ensures the final asymptotic convergence and exponential convergence of the position synchronization tracking error for master-slave robots under the designed event-triggered mechanisms. Eventually, the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control strategy are validated by comparative cases.",,,,,,

To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback.

Bimanual Manipulation 1,Learning Coordinated Bimanual Manipulation Policies Using State Diffusion and Inverse Dynamics Models,"Chen, Haonan;Xu, Jiaming;Sheng, Lily;Ji, Tianchen;Liu, Shuijing;Li, Yunzhu;Driggs-Campbell, Katherine","Keywords: AI-Based Methods, Bimanual Manipulation, Imitation Learning","Abstract: When performing tasks like laundry, humans naturally coordinate both hands to manipulate objects and anticipate how their actions will change the state of the clothes. However, achieving such coordination in robotics remains challenging due to the need to model object movement, predict future states, and generate precise bimanual actions. In this work, we address these challenges by infusing the predictive nature of human manipulation strategies into robot imitation learning. Specifically, we disentangle task-related state transitions from agent-specific inverse dynamics modeling to enable effective bimanual coordination. Using a demonstration dataset, we train a diffusion model to predict future states given historical observations, envisioning how the scene evolves. Then, we use an inverse dynamics model to compute robot actions that achieve the predicted states. Our key insight is that modeling object movement can help learning policies for bimanual coordination manipulation tasks. Evaluating our framework across diverse simulation and real-world manipulation setups, including multimodal goal configurations, bimanual manipulation, deformable objects, and multi-object setups, we find that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art state-to-action mapping policies. Our method demonstrates a remarkable capacity to navigate multimodal goal configurations and action distributions, maintain stability across different control modes, and synthesize a broader range of behaviors than those present in the demonstration dataset.",,,,,,

In this work, we learn folding actions conditioned on text commands. Translating high-level, abstract instructions into precise robotic actions requires sophisticated language understanding and manipulation capabilities. To do that, we leverage a pre-trained vision-language model and repurpose it to predict manipulation actions. Our model, BiFold, can take context into account and achieves stateof-the-art performance on an existing language-conditioned folding benchmark. To address the lack of annotated bimanual folding data, we introduce a novel dataset with automatically parsed actions and language-aligned instructions, enabling better learning of text-conditioned manipulation.

Bimanual Manipulation 1,One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning,"Wang, Yilong;Johns, Edward","Keywords: Dual Arm Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Visual Servoing","Abstract: We introduce One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning (ODIL), which enables dual-arm robots to learn precise and coordinated everyday tasks from just a single demonstration of the task. ODIL uses a new three-stage visual servoing (3-VS) method for precise alignment between the end-effector and target object, after which replay of the demonstration trajectory is sufficient to perform the task. This is achieved without requiring prior task or object knowledge, or additional data collection and training following the single demonstration. Furthermore, we propose a new dual-arm coordination paradigm for learning dual-arm tasks from a single demonstration. ODIL was tested on a real-world dual-arm robot, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six precise and coordinated tasks in both 4-DoF and 6-DoF settings, and showing robustness in the presence of distractor objects and partial occlusions.

Bimanual Manipulation 1,In the Wild Ungraspable Object Picking with Bimanual Nonprehensile Manipulation,"Wu, Albert;Kruse, Daniel","Keywords: Dual Arm Manipulation, Mobile Manipulation, Grasping","Abstract: Picking diverse objects in the real world is a fundamental robotics skill. However, many objects in such settings are bulky, heavy, or irregularly shaped, making them ungraspable by conventional end effectors like suction grippers and parallel jaw grippers (PJGs). In this paper, we expand the range of pickable items without hardware modifications using bimanual nonprehensile manipulation. We focus on a grocery shopping scenario, where a bimanual mobile manipulator equipped with a suction gripper and a PJG is tasked with re- trieving ungraspable items from tightly packed grocery shelves. From visual observations, our method first identifies optimal grasp points based on force closure and friction constraints. If the grasp points are occluded, a series of nonprehensile nudging motions are performed to clear the obstruction. A bimanual grasp utilizing contacts on the side of the end effectors is then executed to grasp the target item. In our replica grocery store, we achieved a 90% success rate over 102 trials in uncluttered scenes, and a 66% success rate over 45 trials in cluttered scenes. We also deployed our system to a real-world grocery store and successfully picked previously unseen items. Our results highlight the potential of bimanual nonprehensile manipulation for in-the-wild robotic picking tasks. A video summarizing this work can be found at youtu.be/g0hOrDuK8jM",,,,,,
Bimanual Manipulation 1,Bimanual Grasp Synthesis for Dexterous Robot Hands,"Shao, Yanming;Xiao, Chenxi","Keywords: Bimanual Manipulation, Grasping, Dexterous Manipulation","Abstract: Humans naturally perform bimanual skills to handle large and heavy objects. To enhance a robot's object manipulation capabilities, generating effective bimanual grasp poses is essential. Nevertheless, bimanual grasp synthesis for dexterous hand manipulators remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the BimanGrasp algorithm for synthesizing bimanual grasps on 3D objects. The BimanGrasp algorithm generates grasp poses by optimizing an energy function that considers grasp stability and feasibility. Furthermore, the quality of the synthesized grasps is verified using the Isaac Gym physics simulation engine. These verified grasp poses form the BimanGrasp-Dataset, which is the first synthesized bimanual dexterous hand grasp pose dataset to our knowledge. The dataset comprises over 150k verified grasps on 900 objects, facilitating the synthesis of bimanual grasps through a data-driven approach.

Grasping 1,Efficient 7-DoF Grasp for Target-Driven Object in Dense Cluttered Scenes,"Lei, Tianjiao;Sun, Yizhuo;Huang, Yi;Huang, Jiangshuai;Jiang, Tao","Keywords: Grasping, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Cyborgs","Abstract: Achieving a real-time precise grasp of a specified target object in densely cluttered environments is an essential capability for autonomous robot operation. Recently, considerable investigations on planar and spatial grasp have been carried out, and significant results have been obtained. However,these point cloud-based grasp prediction methods often fail to ensure that the generated grasp configurations meet the precise requirements of the task. Additionally, some of the existing grasp pipelines are too time-consuming to meet the demand for real-time robot response. In more challenging cluttered scenes,the quality of pose and gripper jaw opening estimation in highdimensional space requires further improvement. Therefore,this paper introduces a data- and model-independent and efficient method to generate 7-DoF grasp configurations for arbitrary target objects from single-view point cloud data in dense cluttered scenes. In addition, this paper proposes a grasp framework that generates the grasp configuration for the target object while reducing the time consumed during the grasp process, to enable robots to efficiently grasp target objects for designated tasks. The grasp pipeline focuses on guided regions via target detection and rapidly adjusts grasp configurations through multi-region point cloud distribution perception. Extensive real-world robot experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in grasping target objects in cluttered scenes, achieving higher success rates and reduced runtime compared to baseline methods.The realized code and video are available at https://github.com/L-tj/7DGCG.",,,,,,
Grasping 1,Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters,"Wang, An-Lan;Chen, Nuo;Lin, Kun-Yu;Yuan-Ming, Li;Zheng, Wei-Shi",Keywords: Grasping,"Abstract: In general, humans would grasp an object differently for different tasks, e.g., ``grasping the handle of a knife to cut'' vs. ``grasping the blade to hand over''. In the field of robotic grasp pose detection research, some existing works consider this task-oriented grasping and made some progress, but they are generally constrained by low-DoF gripper type or non-cluttered setting, which is not applicable for human assistance in real life. With an aim to get more general and practical grasp models, in this paper, we investigate a new problem named Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters (TO6DGC), which extends the task-oriented problem to a more general 6-DOF Grasp Pose Detection in Cluttered (multi-object) scenario. To this end, we construct a large-scale 6-DoF task-oriented grasping dataset, 6-DoF Task Grasp (6DTG), which features 4391 cluttered scenes with over 2 million 6-DoF grasp poses. Each grasp is annotated with a specific task, involving 6 tasks and 198 objects in total. Moreover, we propose One-Stage TaskGrasp (OSTG), a strong baseline to address the TO6DGC problem. Our OSTG adopts a task-oriented point selection strategy to detect where to grasp, and a task-oriented grasp generation module to decide how to grasp given a specific task. To evaluate the effectiveness of OSTG, extensive experiments are conducted on 6DTG. The results show that our method outperforms various baselines on multiple metrics. Real robot experiments also verify that our OSTG has a better perception of the task-oriented grasp points and 6-DoF grasp poses.",,,,,,
Grasping 1,QuickGrasp: Lightweight Antipodal Grasp Planning with Point Clouds,"Ravie, Navin Sriram;Murugan, Keerthi Vasan;Thondiyath, Asokan;Sebastian, Bijo","Keywords: Grasping, Manipulation Planning, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final interface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become complicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the surroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods utilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure sampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning problem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization across domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the lack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic nature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application in real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach towards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to no sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp points on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector pose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for effective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An optimization-based quality metric is then used for evaluation of grasp points to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is compared with existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach Grasp pose detection (GPD) as baseline over multiple simulated objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated in real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned grasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator. The proposed approach shows better performance in terms of higher probability for force closure with a complete repeatability.",,,,,,
Grasping 1,Behavioral Manifolds: Representing the Landscape of Grasp Affordances in Relative Pose Space,"Zechmair, Michael;Morel, Yannick","Keywords: Grasping, Grippers and Other End-Effectors, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: The use of machine learning to investigate grasp affordances has received extensive attention over the past several decades. The existing literature provides a robust basis to build upon, though a number of aspects may be improved. Results commonly work in terms of grasp configuration, with little consideration for the manner in which the grasp may be (re-)produced, from a reachability and trajectory planning perspective. We propose a different perspective on grasp affordance learning, explicitly accounting for grasp synthesis; that is, the manner in which manipulator kinematics are used to allow materialization of grasps. The approach allows to explicitly map the grasp policy space in terms of generated grasp types and associated grasp quality. Results of application to a range of objects illustrate merit of the method and highlight the manner in which it may promote a greater degree of explainability for otherwise intransparent reinforcement processes.",,,,,,
Grasping 1,NeRF-Based Transparent Object Grasping Enhanced by Shape Priors,"Han, Yi;Lin, Zixin;Li, DongJie;Chen, Lvping;Shi, Yongliang;Ma, Gan",Keywords: Grasping,"Abstract: Transparent object grasping remains a persistent challenge in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of acquiring precise 3D information. Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRFÂ’s capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stable, and executable grasp predictions.",,,,,,

Localization 3,How Safe Is Particle Filtering-Based Localization for Mobile Robots? an Integrity Monitoring Approach,"Abdul Hafez, Osama;Joerger, Mathieu;Spenko, Matthew","Keywords: Localization, Probability and Statistical Methods, Robot Safety, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: Deriving safe bounds on particle filter estimate is a research problem that, if solved, could greatly benefit robots in life-critical applications, a field that is facing increasing interest as more robots are being deployed near humans. In response, this paper introduces a new fault detector and derives a performance measure for particle filter: integrity risk. Integrity risk is defined as the probability of having large estimate errors without triggering an alarm, all while considering measurement faults, unknown deterministic errors that cannot be modeled via normal white noise. In this work, the faults come in the form of incorrectly associated features when using the local nearest neighbors. Simulations and experiments assess the efficiency of the introduced safety metric. The results show that safety improves as map density increases as long as the number of particles is sufficient to shape the error distribution and the landmarks are well separated. Also, the results indicate that, when landmarks are poorly separated, particle filter is safer than Kalman filter, whereas, when landmarks are well separated, particle filter is often, but not always, safer than Kalman filter.",,,,,,

One-time scene solving is performed on a computer using a variety of standard computer vision tech-niques. Three different robotic localization scenarios are analyzed in this work. The first is a planar scene with a single lighthouse with a four-point pre-calibration. The second is a planar scene with two light-houses that self calibrates with either multiple robots in the experiment or a single robot in motion. The third extends to a 3D scene with two lighthouses and a self-calibration algorithm. The absolute accuracy, measured against a camera-based tracking system, was found to be 7.25 mm RMS for the 2D case and 11.2 mm RMS for the 3D case, respectively.

In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence.

However, there remains a persistent demand for both robust and fast matching techniques. To address this, we propose a novel Mamba-based local feature matching approach, called MambaGlue, where Mamba is an emerging state-of-the-art architecture rapidly gaining recognition for its superior speed in both training and inference, and promising performance compared with Transformer architectures. In particular, we propose two modules: a) MambaAttention mixer to simultaneously and selectively understand the local and global context through the Mamba-based self-attention structure and b) deep confidence score regressor, which is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture that evaluates a score indicating how confidently matching predictions correspond to the ground-truth correspondences.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) based localization in such complex large-scale environments, named ULOC. First, anchors are deployed in the environment without knowledge of their actual position. Then, UWB observations are collected when the vehicle travels in the environment. At the same time, map-consistent pose estimates are developed from registering (onboard self-localization) data with the prior map to provide the training labels. We then propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on MAMBA that learns the ranging patterns of UWBs over a complex large-scale environment.

Localization 3,Indoor Localization of UAVs Using Only Few Measurements by Output-Sensitive Preimage Intersection,"Bilevich, Michael M.;Buber, Tomer;Halperin, Dan",Keywords: Localization,"Abstract: We present a deterministic approach for the localization of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a known indoor environment by using only a few downward distance measurements and the corresponding odometries between measurements. For each distance measurement and odometry, we look at the preimage of that distance measurement under the downwards distance function combined with the corresponding odometry where the motion between every two measurements has four degrees of freedom: three of translation and one of azimuth change. The intersection of these preimages yields the set of all possible locations for the UAV. In this work, we present an efficient method for approximating that intersection of preimages. We perform a spatial subdivision search, which splits only voxels containing that intersection. We present a novel technique, based on geometric insights, for correctly evaluating whether a voxel indeed contains a true localization. This technique is also robust under different kinds of errors that might occur. Our method is guaranteed to contain the ground truth location, and its runtime complexity is output sensitive, in the Hausdorff dimension and measure of the resulting intersection of preimages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in various indoor scenarios, showing that it can be used to significantly decrease the uncertainty of localization when solving the kidnapped robot problem in simulation and on a physical drone. Our method can be performed in real-time. Furthermore, our method requires only a map of the environment, odometry and ToF sensors, which is advantageous in terms of cost, privacy and transmission bandwidth.

Such design optimization can be modelled as a multi-dimensional non-convex optimization problem with nonlinear constrained conditions. However, it is non-trivial to ensure the essential reachability condition, i.e., the existence of continuous trajectories between demand positions for serial articulated manipulators, given complex spatial constraints, like obstacles and boundaries. Traditional solutions integrate standard motion planning or inverse kinematics algorithms within a kinematic-design optimization process, resulting in significant demand for time and computing resources. To accelerate design optimization at improved efficiency, we design a novel robust design framework built on a new kinematic design synthesis, which allows for simultaneously optimizing dimension and topology of a serial manipulator's kinematics for arbitrary tasks in constrained environments, using a generalised parametric kinematic model. Significantly, in contrast to standard solutions, we develop a novel computationally effective reachability verification method, which rapidly aborts infeasible motions by exploiting efficient collision checks, based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed design framework is verified and evaluated by comparing to baseline benchmarks.

Tactile Sensing 2,Contrastive Touch-To-Touch Pretraining,"Rodriguez, Samanta;Dou, Yiming;van den Bogert, William;Oller, Miquel;So, Kevin;Owens, Andrew;Fazeli, Nima","Keywords: Representation Learning, Force and Tactile Sensing, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: Tactile sensors differ greatly in design, making it challenging to develop general-purpose methods for processing tactile feedback. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive self-supervised learning approach that represents tactile feedback across different sensor types. Our method utilizes paired tactile dataÂ—where two distinct sensors, in our case Soft Bubbles and GelSlims, grasp the same object in the same configurationÂ—to learn a unified latent representation. Unlike current approaches that focus on reconstruction or task-specific supervision, our method employs contrastive learning to create a latent space that captures shared information between sensors. By treating paired tactile signals as positives and unpaired signals as negatives, we show that our model effectively learns a rich, sensor-agnostic representation. Despite significant differences between Soft Bubble and GelSlim sensors, the learned representation enables strong downstream task performance, including zero-shot and few-shot classification and pose estimation. This work provides a scalable solution for integrating tactile data across diverse sensor modalities, advancing the development of generalizable tactile representations.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing 2,ViTract: Robust Object Shape Perception Via Active Visuo-Tactile Interaction,"Dutta, Anirvan;Burdet, Etienne;Kaboli, Mohsen","Keywords: Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Force and Tactile Sensing","Abstract: An essential problem in robotic systems that are to be deployed in unstructured environments is the accurate and autonomous perception of the shapes of previously unseen objects. Existing methods for shape estimation or reconstruction have leveraged either visual or tactile interactive exploration techniques, or have relied on comprehensive visual or tactile information acquired in an offline manner. In this work, a novel visuo-tactile interactive perception framework - ViTract is introduced for shape estimation of unseen objects. Our framework estimates the shape of diverse objects robustly using low-dimensional, efficient, and generalizable shape primitives, which are superquadrics.
The probabilistic formulation within our framework takes advantage of the complementary information provided by vision and tactile observations while accounting for associated noise. As part of our framework, we propose a novel modality-specific information gain to select the most informative and reliable exploratory action (using vision/tactile) to obtain iterative visuo/tactile information. Our real-robot experiments demonstrate superior and robust performance compared to state-of-the-art visuo-tactile-based shape estimation techniques.",,,,,,
Tactile Sensing 2,Location and Orientation Super-Resolution Sensing with a Cost-Efficient and Repairable Barometric Tactile Sensor,"Hou, Jian;Zhou, Xin;Spiers, Adam","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Grippers and Other End-Effectors, Barometric Sensing","Abstract: The adoption of tactile sensors in robotics is hindered by their high cost and fragility. We designed and validated a cost-effective and robust barometric tactile sensor array, whose material cost is below 80 USD. Unlike past work, we do not mold the rubber surface over the barometers but instead keep it as a separate element, leading to a design that is easy to fabricate and repair. Machine learning techniques are applied to enhance the sensorÂ’s localization precision, increasing the effective resolution from 6 mm (the distance between adjacent barometers) to 0.284 mm. To investigate the localization modelÂ’s robustness, we utilized an E-TRoll robotic gripper to roll differently shaped prismatic objects across the sensing surface mounted on one finger. Under these uncontrolled settings, we achieved a satisfactory real-time localization resolution of within 2.68 mm. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel practical application: The E-TRoll mimics a 1-DoF parallel gripper inferring a cubeÂ’s orientation relative to the sensor. The range of orientations is split into 4 classes, which a trained CNN-LSTM model can predict with an 86.91% five-fold cross-validated accuracy.",,,,,,
Human Motion Sensing,Person Re-Identification for Robot Person Following with Online Continual Learning,"Ye, Hanjing;Zhao, Jieting;Zhan, Yu;Chen, Weinan;He, Li;Zhang, Hong","Keywords: Human-Centered Automation, Computer Vision for Automation, Continual Learning","Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a crucial capability in human-robot interaction (HRI) applications, allowing a robot to persistently follow a designated person. In practical RPF scenarios, the person can often be occluded by other objects or people. Consequently, it is necessary to re-identify the person when he/she reappears within the robot's field of view. Previous person re-identification (ReID) approaches to person following rely on a fixed feature extractor. Such an approach often fails to generalize to different viewpoints and lighting conditions in practical RPF environments. In other words, it suffers from the so-called domain shift problem where it cannot re-identify the person when his re-appearance is out of the domain modeled by the fixed feature extractor. To mitigate this problem, we propose a ReID framework for RPF where we use a feature extractor that is optimized online with both short-term and long-term experiences (i.e., recently and previously observed samples during RPF) using the online continual learning (OCL) framework. The long-term experiences are maintained by a memory manager to enable OCL to update the feature extractor. Our experiments demonstrate that even in the presence of severe appearance changes and distractions from visually similar people, the proposed method can still re-identify the person more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities.

Human Motion Sensing,Relevance-Driven Decision Making for Safer and More Efficient Human Robot Collaboration,"Zhang, Xiaotong;Huang, Dingcheng;Youcef-Toumi, Kamal","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Cognitive Modeling, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: Human brain possesses the ability to effectively focus on important environmental components, which enhances perception, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, we introduced a novel concept termed relevance for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Relevance is a dimensionality reduction process that incorporates a continuously operating perception module, evaluates cue sufficiency within the scene, and applies a flexible formulation and computation framework. In this paper, we present an enhanced two-loop framework that integrates real-time and asynchronous processing to quantify relevance and leverage it for safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC). The two-loop framework integrates an asynchronous loop, which leverages an LLMÂ’s world knowledge to quantify relevance, and a real-time loop, which performs scene understanding, human intent prediction, and decision-making based on relevance. HRC decision-making is enhanced by a relevance-based task allocation method, as well as a motion generation and collision avoidance approach that incorporates human trajectory prediction. Simulations and experiments show that our methodology for relevance quantification can accurately and robustly predict the human objective and relevance, with an average accuracy of up to 0.90 for objective prediction and up to 0.96 for relevance prediction. Moreover, our motion generation methodology reduces collision cases by 63.76% and collision frames by 44.74% when compared with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) collision avoidance method. Our framework and methodologies, with relevance, guide the robot on how to best assist humans and generate safer and more efficient actions for HRC.",,,,,,
Human Motion Sensing,Back to the Cartesian: Pilot Study for Assessing Human Stiffness in 3D Cartesian Space by Transforming from Muscle Space in a Peg-In-Hole Scenario for Tele-Impedance,"Thuerauf, Sabine;Mehrkens, Florian;Castellini, Claudio;Sierotowicz, Marek","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Compliance and Impedance Control, Intention Recognition","Abstract: For various teleoperation tasks, position-based control is not practical. An impedance-based control is superior e.g. for handling fragile objects, like harvesting fruits or grasping a paper cup. However, only a few researchers have focused on impedance control for teleoperation. In tele-impedance, the stiffness of a human is measured and transferred to a controller of a robot. Until now, human stiffness was mostly measured either for specific joints or in 2D Cartesian space. We introduce a new way of measuring Cartesian stiffness in 3D using electromyography. Users were asked to perform a peg-in-hole task in three different orientations (0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â°). Meanwhile, electromyography measurements at shoulder and elbow muscle groups are performed. In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that the measured stiffness matrix in Cartesian space differed significantly across the three differently oriented peg-in-hole scenarios. This demonstrates that human stiffness could be predicted in 3D Cartesian space based on the type of task at hand.",,,,,,

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel FISHnCHIPS dataset, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses.",,,,,,
Human Motion Sensing,HuMAn Â– the Human Motion Anticipation Algorithm Based on Recurrent Neural Networks,"Noppeney, Victor;Escalante, Felix M;Maggi, Lucas;Boaventura, Thiago","Keywords: Modeling and Simulating Humans, Human and Humanoid Motion Analysis and Synthesis, Intention Recognition","Abstract: Predicting human motion may lead to considerable advantages for human-robot interaction, particularly when precise synchronization between the robotÂ’s motion and the userÂ’s movement is imperative. The inherent stochastic nature of human behavior, combined with the restricted window of response, can give rise to residual and undesirable forces during interactions, potentially harming the user. Therefore, efficient prediction of human joint movements may enhance the performance of various interaction control frameworks used in wearable robots. This paper proposes the HuMAn algorithm for predicting human joint motion based on a recurrent neural network. This algorithm consists of a long-term memory network, used to interpret sequences of poses, and a prediction layer, employed to build the most likely future user poses within a specified time horizon. Network training was performed using datasets encompassing various subjects and types of motion. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as evidenced by average general prediction errors below 0.1 radians for predictive horizons of up to 500 milliseconds. Furthermore, a mean absolute error of 0.026 radians was achieved for a periodic treadmill walk.

Prior works augment training data only in next-best-view applications, which lead to hallucinations and model collapse with sparse data. In contrast, we propose adding a set of views during training by rejection sampling from a posterior uncertainty distribution, generated by combining a volumetric uncertainty estimator with spatial coverage. We validate our results on partially observed scenes; on average, our method performs 39.9% better with 87.5% less variability across established scene reconstruction benchmarks, as compared to state of the art baselines. We further demonstrate that augmenting the training set by sampling from any distribution leads to better, more consistent scene reconstruction in sparse environments.

For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSe is able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.",,,,,,

For this to occur, humans internally estimate how hand movements affect the object's movement. We wish to endow robots with this capability. We contribute methodology to jointly estimate the geometry and pose of objects grasped by a robot, from RGB images captured by an external camera. Notably, our method transforms the estimated geometry into the robot's coordinate frame, while not requiring the extrinsic parameters of the external camera to be calibrated. Our approach leverages 3D foundation models, large models pre-trained on huge datasets for 3D vision tasks, to produce initial estimates of the in-hand object. These initial estimations do not have physically correct scales and are in the camera's frame. Then, we formulate, and efficiently solve, a coordinate-alignment problem to recover accurate scales, along with a transformation of the objects to the coordinate frame of the robot. Forward kinematics mappings can subsequently be defined from the manipulator's joint angles to specified points on the object. These mappings enable the estimation of points on the held object at arbitrary configurations, enabling robot motion to be designed with respect to coordinates on the grasped objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a robot manipulator holding a diverse set of real-world objects.",,,,,,

While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception Â— the robotÂ’s internal sensing capabilities Â— and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems.

This study presents a novel framework that integrates Reservoir Computing (RC) with the First-Order Reduced and Controlled Error (FORCE) learning rule to enhance policy adaptability in RL. The RC serves as a dynamic feature extractor, capturing temporal dependencies by pre-training on state transitions generated through random actions. This pre-training acts as regularization, reducing variance and preventing overfitting to specific configurations Subsequently, the control policy network is trained on a limited set of body variations using the enriched features from the RC.

Recent studies have developed a meta-learning-based adaptive control scheme, which uses meta-learning to extract nonlinear features (represented by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)) from offline data, and uses adaptive control to update linear coefficients online. However, such a scheme is fundamentally limited by the linear parameterization of uncertainties and does not fully unleash the capability of DNNs. This paper introduces a novel learning-based adaptive control framework that pretrains a DNN via self-supervised meta-learning (SSML) from offline trajectories and online adapts the full DNN via composite adaptation. In particular, the offline SSML stage leverages the time consistency in trajectory data to train the DNN to predict future disturbances from history, in a self-supervised manner without environment condition labels. The online stage carefully designs a control law and an adaptation law to update the full DNN with stability guarantees. Empirically, the proposed framework significantly outperforms (19-39%) various classic and learning-based adaptive control baselines, in challenging real-world quadrotor tracking problems under large dynamic wind disturbance.",,,,,,

Autonomous Vehicle Perception 3,Low-Rank Adaptation-Based All-Weather Removal for Autonomous Navigation,"Rajagopalan, Sudarshan;Patel, Vishal","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: All-weather image restoration (AWIR) is crucial for reliable autonomous navigation under adverse weather conditions. AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

SLAM 4,Introspective Loop Closure for SLAM with 4D Imaging Radar,"Hilger, Maximilian;Kubelka, Vladimir;Adolfsson, Daniel;Becker, Ralf;Andreasson, Henrik;Lilienthal, Achim J.","Keywords: SLAM, Mapping, Localization","Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows mobile robots to navigate without external positioning systems or pre-existing maps. Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.",,,,,,
SLAM 4,Range-Based 6-DoF Monte Carlo SLAM with Gradient-Guided Particle Filter on GPU,"Nakao, Takumi;Koide, Kenji;Takanose, Aoki;Oishi, Shuji;Yokozuka, Masashi;Date, Hisashi","Keywords: SLAM, Mapping, Range Sensing","Abstract: This paper presents range-based 6-DoF Monte Carlo SLAM with a gradient-guided particle update strategy. While non-parametric state estimation methods, such as particle filters, are robust in situations with high ambiguity, they are known to be unsuitable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a particle update strategy that improves the sampling efficiency by using the gradient information of the likelihood function to guide particles toward its local maxima. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe-based map representation that represents the global map as a set of past frames (i.e., keyframes) to mitigate memory consumption. The keyframe poses for each particle are corrected using a simple loop closure method to maintain trajectory consistency. The combination of gradient information and keyframe-based map representation significantly enhances sampling efficiency and reduces memory usage compared to traditional RBPF approaches. To process a large number of particles (e.g., 100,000 particles) in real-time, the proposed framework is designed to fully exploit GPU parallel processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits extreme robustness to state ambiguity and can even deal with kidnapping situations, such as when the sensor moves to different floors via an elevator, with minimal heuristics.",,,,,,

In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.",,,,,,

Moreover, compared to LiDAR sensors, 4D imaging radar is more cost-effective and offers enhanced durability against challenging weather conditions. Despite these advantages, radar-based localization systems face several challenges, including limited resolution, leading to scattered object recognition and less precise localization. Additionally, existing methods that form submaps from filtered results can accumulate errors, leading to blurred submaps and reducing the accuracy of the SLAM and odometry. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Radar4VoxMap, a novel approach designed to enhance radar-only odometry.

However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-topoint error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process.

In the letter, a high-frequency and resilient initialization framework is designed for LiDAR-inertial systems, leveraging both inertial sensors and Doppler LiDAR. The innovative FMCW Doppler LiDAR opens up a novel avenue for robotic sensing by capturing not only point range but also Doppler velocity via the intrinsic Doppler effect. By fusing point-wise Doppler velocity with inertial measurements under non-inertial kinematics, the proposed framework, Free-Init, eliminates reliance on motion undistortion of LiDAR scans, excitation motions, and map correspondences during the initialization phase. Free-Init is also plug-and-play compatible with typical LiDAR-inertial systems and is versatile to handle a wide range of initial motions when the system starts, including stationary, dynamic, and even violent motions. The embedded Doppler-inertial velocimeter ensures fast convergence and high-frequency performance, delivering outputs exceeding 10 kHz.

In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times.

We develop a powerful and lightweight latched series-elastic actuator using a twisted string and carbon fiber springs. We consider the effects of scaling down conventional quadrupeds and experimentally show how storing energy in a parallel-elastic fashion using a latch increases jump energy compared to series-elastic or springless strategies. By switching between series and parallel-elastic modes with our latched 5-bar leg mechanism, Pinto executes energetic jumps as well as maintains continuous control during shorter bounding motions.

The curve is approximated with a spherical four-bar, which is synthesized through optimal rigid body guidance. We specify the desired SO(3) motion using discrete task positions, then solve for candidate mechanisms by computing all roots of the stationary conditions using numerical homotopy continuation. A caterpillar robot prototype demonstrates the utility of this approach. This synthesis procedure is also used to design prolegs for the caterpillar robot.

Sensor Fusion 1,A Hessian for Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods in Nonlinear Least Squares,"Korotkine, Vassili;Cohen, Mitchell;Forbes, James Richard","Keywords: Sensor Fusion, Probabilistic Inference, SLAM","Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Hessian approximation for Maximum a Posteriori estimation problems in robotics involving Gaussian mixture likelihoods. Previous approaches manipulate the Gaussian mixture likelihood into a form that allows the problem to be represented as a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. The resulting Hessian approximation used within NLS solvers from these approaches neglects certain nonlinearities. The proposed Hessian approximation is derived by setting the Hessians of the Gaussian mixture component errors to zero, which is the same starting point as for the Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation for NLS, and using the chain rule to account for additional nonlinearities. The proposed Hessian approximation results in improved convergence speed and uncertainty characterization for simulated experiments, and similar performance to the state of the art on real-world experiments.

Sensor Fusion 1,Unveiling the Depths: A Multi-Modal Fusion Framework for Challenging Scenarios,"Xu, Jialei;Li, Rui;Cheng, Kai;Jiang, Junjun;Liu, Xianming","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Sensor Fusion, RGB-D Perception","Abstract: Monocular depth estimation from RGB images plays a pivotal role in 3D vision. However, its accuracy can deteriorate in challenging environments such as nighttime or adverse weather conditions. While long-wave infrared cameras offer stable imaging in such challenging conditions, they are inherently low-resolution, lacking rich texture and semantics as delivered by the RGB image. Current methods focus solely on a single modality due to the difficulties to identify and integrate faithful depth cues from both sources. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that identifies and integrates dominant cross-modality depth features with a learning-based framework. Concretely, we independently compute the coarse depth maps with separate networks by fully utilizing the individual depth cues from each modality. As the advantageous depth spreads across both modalities, we propose a novel confidence loss steering a confidence predictor network to yield a confidence map specifying latent potential depth areas. With the resulting confidence map, we propose a multi-modal fusion network that fuses the final depth in an end-to-end manner. Harnessing the proposed pipeline, our method demonstrates the ability of robust depth estimation in a variety of difficult scenarios. Experimental results on the challenging MS^2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.",,,,,,

For this purpose, many autonomous vehicles employ multi-modal sensor systems, including an RGB camera, NIR camera, thermal camera, LiDAR, or Radar. They mainly adopt two strategies to use multiple sensors: modality-wise and multi-modal fused inference. The former method is flexible but memory-inefficient, unreliable, and vulnerable. Multi-modal fusion can provide high-level reliability, yet it needs a specialized architecture. In this paper, we propose an effective solution, named align-and-fuse strategy, for the depth estimation from multi-spectral images. In the align stage, we align embedding spaces between multiple spectrum bands to learn shareable representation across multi-spectral images by minimizing contrastive loss of global and spatially aligned local features with geometry cues. After that, in the fuse stage, we train an attachable feature fusion module that can selectively aggregate the multi-spectral features for reliable and robust prediction results.

Accurate control of the thrust generated by each rotor during flight is one of the main challenges for robust control of quadrotors. The most common approach is to approximate the mapping of rotor speed to thrust with a simple quadratic model.

One of the approaches to modeling the aerodynamics around the propellers is the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT). Here, we propose a novel BEMT-based closed-loop thrust estimator and control to eliminate the laborious calibration step of finding several aerodynamic coefficients. We aim to reuse known values as a baseline and fit the thrust estimate to values closest to the real ones with a simple test bench experiment, resulting in a single scaling value. A feedforward PID thrust control was implemented for each rotor, and the methods were validated by outdoor experiments with two multirotor UAV platforms: 250mm and 500mm.

This work presents the first neural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain randomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The effectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across different platforms.

In this study, we propose control methods for a system where multiple aerial robots are interconnected with passive flexible elements. These robotic systems enhance adaptability, enabling tasks like object manipulation. We model the flexible parts using the piecewise constant strain (PCS) model, which allows for model-based closed-loop control and stabilizes various configurations of the system.

Notably, we succeeded in maintaining stable flight, which was not possible with traditional methods, and demonstrated both positional controllability and the ability of the flexible parts to bend dynamically during flight.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots: Mechanics and Control 1,Embodying Compliant Touch on Drones for Aerial Tactile Navigation,"Bredenbeck, Anton;Della Santina, Cosimo;Hamaza, Salua","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Aerial Systems: Perception and Autonomy, Compliant Joints and Mechanisms","Abstract: Aerial robots are a well-established solution for environmental surveying, exploration, and inspection, thanks to their superior maneuverability and agility. Nowadays, the algorithms that provide these capabilities rely on GNSS and Vision, which are obstructed in some environments of interest, e.g., indoors and underground or in smoke and dust. In similar conditions, animals rely on the sense of touch and compliant responses to interactions embodied in the body morphology. This way, they can navigate safely using tactile cues by feeling the environment surrounding them. In this work, we take inspiration from the natural example and propose an approach that allows a quadrotor to navigate using tactile information from the environment. We propose to endow a conventional quadrotor with a novel robotic finger that embodies compliance and sensing capabilities. We complete this design with a navigation approach that generates new waypoints based on the robotic finger's contact information to follow the unknown environment. The overall system's evaluation shows successful, repeatable results in 36 flight experiments with various relative angles between the drone and a planar surface.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Navigation 2,Adaptive Learning for Hybrid Visual Odometry,"Liu, Ziming;Malis, Ezio;Martinet, Philippe","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Visual Learning, Computer Vision for Transportation","Abstract: Hybrid visual odometry methods achieve state-of-the-art performance by fusing both data-based deep learning networks and rule-based localization approaches. However, these methods also suffer from deep learning domain gap problems, which leads to an accuracy drop of the hybrid visual odometry approach when new type of data is considered. This paper is the first to explore a practical solution to this problem. Indeed, the deep learning network in the hybrid visual odometry predicts the stereo disparity with fixed searching space. However, the disparity distribution is unbalanced in stereo images acquired in different environments. We propose an adaptive network structure to overcome this problem. Secondly, the rule-based localization module has a robust performance by online optimizing the camera pose in test data, which motivates us to introduce test-time training machine learning method for improving the data-based part of the hybrid visual odometry.",,,,,,

We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Navigation 2,SSF: Sparse Long-Range Scene Flow for Autonomous Driving,"Khoche, Ajinkya;Zhang, Qingwen;Pereira Sanchez, Laura;Asefaw, Aron;Sharif Mansouri, Sina;Jensfelt, Patric","Keywords: Deep Learning Methods, Computer Vision for Transportation, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization","Abstract: Scene flow enables an understanding of the motion characteristics of the environment in the 3D world. It gains particular significance in the long-range, where object-based perception methods might fail due to sparse observations far away. Although significant advancements have been made in scene flow pipelines to handle large-scale point clouds, a gap remains in scalability with respect to long-range. We attribute this limitation to the common design choice of using dense feature grids, which scale quadratically with range. In this paper, we propose Sparse Scene Flow (SSF), a general pipeline for long-range scene flow, adopting a sparse convolution based backbone for feature extraction. This approach introduces a new challenge: a mismatch in size and ordering of sparse feature maps between time-sequential point scans. To address this, we propose a sparse feature fusion scheme, that augments the feature maps with virtual voxels at missing locations. Additionally, we propose a range-wise metric that implicitly gives greater importance to faraway points. Our method, SSF, achieves state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse2 dataset, demonstrating strong performance in long-range scene flow estimation.

Vision-Based Navigation 2,BoxMap: Efficient Structural Mapping and Navigation,"Wang, Zili;Allum, Christopher;Andersson, Sean;Tron, Roberto","Keywords: Deep Learning Methods, Autonomous Agents, Task and Motion Planning","Abstract: While humans can successfully navigate using abstractions, ignoring details that are irrelevant to the task at hand, most of the existing approaches in robotics require detailed environment representations which consume a significant amount of sensing, computing, and storage; these issues become particularly important in resource-constrained settings with limited power budgets. Deep learning methods can learn from prior experience to abstract knowledge from novel environments, and use it to more efficiently execute tasks such as frontier exploration, object search, or scene understanding. We propose BoxMap, a Detection-Transformer-based architecture that takes advantage of the structure of the sensed partial environment to update a topological graph of the environment as a set of semantic entities (rooms and doors) and their relations (connectivity). The predictions from low-level measurements can be leveraged to achieve high-level goals with lower computational costs than methods based on detailed representations. As an example application, we consider a robot equipped with a 2-D laser scanner tasked with exploring a residential building. Our BoxMap representation scales quadratically with the number of rooms (with a small constant), resulting in significant savings over a full geometric map. Moreover, our high-level topological representation results in 30.9% shorter trajectories in the exploration task with respect to a standard method. Code is available at: bit.ly/3F6w2Yl.",,,,,,
Vision-Based Navigation 2,UncAD: Towards Safe End-To-End Autonomous Driving Via Online Map Uncertainty,"Yang, Pengxuan;Zheng, Yupeng;Zhang, Qichao;Zhu, Kefei;Xing, Zebin;Lin, Qiao;Liu, Yun-Fu;Su, Zhiguo;Zhao, Dongbin","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Integrated Planning and Learning, Computer Vision for Transportation","Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction, and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a 1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%.

Vision-Based Navigation 2,Multi-Floor Zero-Shot Object Navigation Policy,"Zhang, Lingfeng;Wang, Hao;Xiao, Erjia;Zhang, Xinyao;Zhang, Qiang;Jiang, Zixuan;Xu, Renjing","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Embodied Cognitive Science, Visual Learning","Abstract: Object navigation in multi-floor environments presents a formidable challenge in robotics, requiring sophisticated spatial reasoning and adaptive exploration strategies. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on single-floor scenarios, overlooking the complexities introduced by multi-floor structures. To address these challenges, we first propose a Multi-floor Navigation Policy (MFNP) and implement it in Zero-Shot object navigation tasks. Our framework comprises three key components: (i) Multi-floor Navigation Policy, which enables an agent to explore across multiple floors; (ii) Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning in the navigation process; and (iii) Inter-Floor Navigation, ensuring efficient floor transitions. We evaluate MFNP on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Matterport 3D (MP3D) datasets, both include multi-floor scenes. Our experiment results demonstrate that MFNP significantly outperforms all the existing methods in Zero-Shot object navigation, achieving higher success rates and improved exploration efficiency. Ablation studies further highlight the effectiveness of each component in addressing the unique challenges of multi-floor navigation. Meanwhile, we conducted real-world experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our policy. Upon deployment of MFNP, the Unitree quadruped robot demonstrated successful multi-floor navigation and found the target object in a completely unseen environment. By introducing MFNP, we offer a new paradigm for tackling complex, multi-floor environments in object navigation tasks, opening avenues for future research in visual-based navigation in realistic, multi-floor settings.",,,,,,

Federated learning presents a compelling alternative, however, vanilla Federated Learning methods deployed in robotics aim to learn a single global model across robots that works ideally for all. But in practice one model may not be well suited for robots deployed in various environments. This paper proposes Federated-EmbedCluster (Fed-EC), a clustering-based federated learning framework that is deployed with vision based autonomous robot navigation in diverse outdoor environments. The framework addresses the key federated learning challenge of deteriorating model performance of a single global model due to the presence of non-IID data across real-world robots. Extensive real-world experiments validate that Fed-EC reduces the communication size by 23x for each robot while matching the performance of centralized learning for goal-oriented navigation and outperforms local learning. Fed-EC can transfer previously learnt models to new robots that join the cluster.",,,,,,
Perception 1,Using a Distance Sensor to Detect Deviations in a Planar Surface,"Sifferman, Carter;Sun, William;Gupta, Mohit;Gleicher, Michael","Keywords: Range Sensing, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: We investigate methods for determining if a planar surface contains geometric deviations (e.g. protrusions, objects, divots, or cliffs) using only an instantaneous measurement from a miniature optical time-of-flight sensor. The key to our method is to utilize the entirety of information encoded in raw time-of-flight data captured by off-the-shelf distance sensors. We provide an analysis of the problem in which we identify the key ambiguity between geometry and surface photometrics. To overcome this challenging ambiguity, we fit a Gaussian mixture model to a small dataset of planar surface measurements. This model implicitly captures the expected geometry and distribution of photometrics of the planar surface and is used to identify measurements that are likely to contain deviations. We characterize our method on a variety of surfaces and planar deviations across a range of scenarios. We find that our method utilizing raw time-of-flight data outperforms baselines which use only derived distance estimates. We build an example application in which our method enables mobile robot obstacle and cliff avoidance over a wide field-of-view.",,,,,,
Perception 1,Narrowing Your FOV with SOLiD: Spatially Organized and Lightweight Global Descriptor for FOV-Constrained LiDAR Place Recognition,"Kim, Hogyun;Choi, Jiwon;Sim, Taehu;Kim, Giseop;Cho, Younggun","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Range Sensing","Abstract: We often encounter limited FOV situations due to various factors such as sensor fusion or sensor mount in real-world robot navigation. However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released.

The fundamental aspect of endoscopic navigation lies in precisely and continuously tracing the position and orientation of the endoscope within monocular endoscopic video sequences in a preoperative data space. This work proposes a new spatially constrained and deeply learned bilateral structural intensity-depth 2D-3D registration framework for autonomously navigating a flexible endoscope. Concretely, a novel bilateral structural intensity-depth similarity function is defined to tackle the deficiency of using image intensity, while a cross-domain monocular depth estimation model trained on virtual image data is used to accurately predict real image dense depth. Additionally, a spatial constraint is introduced to precisely reinitialize an optimizer to reduce accumulative tracking errors. We validate our method on clinical data, with the experimental results showing that our method significantly outperforms current vision-based navigation methods. Particularly, the average of position and orientation errors were reduced from (4.59mm, 9.22degree) to (1.65mm, 4.67degree).",,,,,,

Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras are equipped with the ability to capture object motion information at exceptionally high temporal resolution with relatively low power consumption and remain immune from motion-blurring effects. Regrettably, many existing methods adopt a frame-based approach by stacking events into Event Frame, which overlooks the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events. This approach is reliant on the pre-training backbone and reaches a performance plateau but demands unrealistically large networks and high power consumption, rendering it impractical for real-time applications in battery-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective single-modality tracker using Point Cloud representation named E2B (Event to Box). By directly handling the raw output of event cameras without dataformat transformation, E2B leverages events' coordinate guidance to accurately map Event Cloud features to 2D bounding boxes. Moreover, E2B incorporates the pyramid structure into the multi-stage feature extraction architecture to effectively track objects across diverse scales. In the experiments, E2B performs outstandingly on two large-scale and one synthetic event-based tracking datasets, covering both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as rigid and non-rigid objects.",,,,,,
Perception 1,FÂ²RÂ²: Frequency Filtering-Based Rectification Robustness Method for Stereo Matching,"Zhou, Haolong;Zhu, Dongchen;Zhang, Guanghui;Wang, Lei;Li, Jiamao",Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception,"Abstract: Most stereo matching networks assume that the stereo images are perfectly rectified, ignoring the perturbation of extrinsic parameters due to collisions, mechanical vibrations, and thermal expansion. This leads to poor rectification robustness in real-world stereo systems. That is, even minor rectification errors can lead to failure, making stereo systems unreliable for long-term autonomous operation in complex environments. In this paper, we are the first to propose a frequency filtering-based rectification robustness (FÂ²RÂ²) method for stereo matching, which aims to enhance the robustness of existing stereo networks to rectification errors. Specifically, we propose a sensitive frequency filter (SFF) to remove components susceptible to rectification errors within the frequency domain. SFF achieves the filtering through the learning-based adaptive filtering mask (AFM) guided by the spatial-frequency mapping modulation mask (SFM). Moreover, we build the matching feature reconstruction module (MFRM) to recover the features lost during filtering to benefit cost aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on simulated datasets and self-collected data validate that our method can significantly enhance the rectification robustness of stereo matching networks.",,,,,,

In contrast to existing methods that involve flying the UAV manually to collect the data for system identification and tuning, our approach leverages relay-based system identification and tuning that autonomously generates stable oscillations, without the need for stabilizing controller. The whole process concludes within few seconds. Prior work in vision-based position control of the UAVs often ignores the delay from the perception pipeline, which is quite significant and results in suboptimal tuning and poor control performance. Our approach accounts for perception delay and addresses practical issues, such as varying delays due to varying computation requirements and inevitable estimation errors, which pose challenges in applying relay-based identification and tuning. Typically, VBL system introduces over 100 ms delay, compared to less than 20 ms delay when motion capture system is used. Moreover, we show that the perception delay identified by VisTune can be effectively used to temporally advance the feedforward acceleration signal to achieve better tracking performance. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the tuned controllers on a trajectory tracking task, reaching speed up to 2.1 m/s with RMS control error of only 0.054 m while under wind disturbance of 5 m/s we report RMSE of 0.116 m.

In addition, the network model does not adapt to changes in the robot's body, the tools that are grasped, or the environment, and there is no unified theory, not only for control but also for state estimation, anomaly detection, simulation, and so on. In this study, we propose a Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model (GeMuCo), in which the robot itself acquires a body schema describing the correlation between sensors and actuators from its own experience, including model structures such as network input/output.

In POMDP scenarios, the agent must infer the unobserved environmental state from raw sensory observations, e.g., pixels in an image. Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate.",,,,,,
Representation Learning 2,Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning,"Keller, Leon;Tanneberg, Daniel;Peters, Jan","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Representation Learning, Task and Motion Planning","Abstract: Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.",,,,,,

To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data --- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt.

Given the commonalities in the skill sets, teaching each skill to each different robot independently is inefficient and not scalable when the large variety in the robotic landscape is considered. If we can learn the correspondences between the sensorimotor spaces of different robots, we can expect a skill that is learned in one robot can be more directly and easily transferred to other robots. In this paper, we propose a method to learn correspondences hakan{among two or more robots that may have different morphologies. To be specific, besides robots with similar morphologies with different degrees of freedom, we show that a fixed-based manipulator robot with joint control and a differential drive mobile robot can be addressed within the proposed framework. To set up the correspondence among the robots considered, an initial base task is demonstrated to the robots to achieve the same goal. Then, a common latent representation is learned along with the individual robot policies for achieving the goal.} After the initial learning stage, the observation of a new task execution by one robot becomes sufficient to generate a latent space representation pertaining to the other robots to achieve the same task. We verified our system in a set of experiments where the correspondence between robots is learned (1) when the robots need to follow the same paths to achieve the same task, (2) when the robots need to follow different trajectories to achieve the same task, and (3) when complexities of the required sensorimotor trajectories are different for the robots.

Multi-Robot Exploration,Planning-Oriented Cooperative Perception among Heterogeneous Vehicles,"Zheng, Han;Ye, Fan;Yang, Yuanyuan","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Cooperating Robots, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) based cooperative perception enhances autonomous driving by overcoming single-agent perception limitations such as occlusions, without relying on extensive infrastructure. However, most existing methods have two key limitations. They treat cooperative perception in isolation, with little consideration for downstream tasks such as planning, leading to poor coordination and inefficient planning decisions. They also assume perception model homogeneity across all vehicles, which can be impractical among vehicles from different manufacturers. To bridge such gaps, we propose Scout, an early-fusion framework for planning-oriented cooperative perception among vehicles of heterogeneous models. Specifically, we formalize a notion of emph{Deltatheta-Risk Increment Distribution (RID)} to capture the distribution of the risk increment by incomplete perception to the current trajectory plan, and define a Priority Index (PI) metric for prioritizing cooperative perception on riskier regions. We develop algorithms to estimate emph{Delta theta-RID} and PI at run-time with theoretical bounds. Empirical results demonstrate that Scout surpasses state-of-the-art methods and strong baselines on challenging benchmarks, achieving higher success rates with only 3-10% of their communication volume.",,,,,,

To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into ""Agent Move Statement"" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that is used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems.",,,,,,

Multi-Robot Exploration,Communication-Aware Iterative Map Compression for Online Path-Planning,"Psomiadis, Evangelos;Pedram, Ali Reza;Maity, Dipankar;Tsiotras, Panagiotis","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Mapping","Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of optimizing communicated information among heterogeneous, resource-aware robot teams to facilitate their navigation. In such operations, a mobile robot compresses its local map to assist another robot in reaching a target within an uncharted environment. The primary challenge lies in ensuring that the map compression step balances network load while transmitting only the most essential information for effective navigation. We propose a communication framework that sequentially selects the optimal map compression in a task-driven, communication-aware manner. It introduces a decoder capable of iterative map estimation, handling noise through Kalman filter techniques. The computational speed of our decoder allows for a larger compression template set compared to previous methods, and enables applications in more challenging environments. Specifically, our simulations demonstrate a remarkable 98% reduction in communicated information, compared to a framework that transmits the raw data, on a large Mars inclination map and an Earth map, all while maintaining similar planning costs. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces computational time compared to the state-of-the-art approach.",,,,,,

However, current wireless communication systems are unable to support feature-level and raw-level collaborative algorithms due to their enormous bandwidth demands. In this paper, we propose DiffCP, a novel CP paradigm that utilizes a diffusion model to efficiently compress the sensing information of collaborators. By incorporating both geometric and semantic conditions into the generative model, DiffCP enables feature-level collaboration with an ultra-low communication cost, advancing the practical implementation of CP systems. This paradigm can be seamlessly integrated into existing CP algorithms to enhance a wide range of downstream tasks. Through extensive experimentation, we investigate the trade-offs between communication, computation, and performance.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called APF-CPP (Artificial Potential Field Based Multi-Robot Online Coverage Path Planning) to enhance the collaboration of multi-robot systems to accomplish coverage tasks in unknown dynamic environments. Our approach presents a unique coverage policy that leverages the concept of artificial potential field (APF). In contrast to the conventional APF-based path planning methods that directly generate paths based on the field gradient, we utilize the APF to derive coverage policies for individual robots within a multi-robot system to achieve efficient task allocation and maintain regular coverage patterns. We have developed a policy update mechanism that allows the system to adapt its task allocation policy based on real-time conditions while minimizing the impact caused by policy changes. To better handle dead-end conditions, we use the APF concept to allocate tasks better during the dead-end recovery process. We also show that our algorithm has a low computational complexity and guarantees complete coverage in a finite time.

Unlike existing marching methods that rely on approximate discretized solutions to the Eikonal equation, our approach achieves exact wavefront propagation by pivoting the analytic distance function based on visibility. The algorithm leverages a dynamic-programming subroutine to efficiently evaluate visibility queries. Through benchmarking against state-of-the-art any-angle path planners, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both speed and accuracy, particularly in cluttered environments.

Multi-Robot Path Planning 2,ICBSS: An Improved Algorithm for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding,"Chen, Zheng;Chen, Changlin;Yiran, Ni","Keywords: Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Collision Avoidance, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: The Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF) problem is a generalized version of the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, in which each agent must collectively visit multiple intermediate target locations on the way to their final destinations. The state-of-the-art approach for addressing MCPF, known as Conflict-Based Steiner Search (CBSS) cite{DBLP:journals/trob/RenRC23}, leverages K-best joint sequences to create multiple search trees, and employs CBS-like search to resolve collisions for each tree. Despite its optimality guarantee, CBSS is computationally burdensome due to the duplicated collision resolutions across multiple trees and the computation of the K-best joint sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm called Improved Conflict-Based Steiner Search (ICBSS), aiming at expediting CBSS by replacing the multi trees with a single conflict tree (CT), which can be implemented by interleaving the time-dependent traveling salesman algorithm to compute the optimal joint path for agents under the newly generated constraints in each CT vertex. Additionally, we introduce a sub-optimal variant of ICBSS, which improves computational efficiency at the expense of solution optimality. Empirical results show that ICBSS outperforms state-of-the-art MCPF algorithms on a variety of MAPF instances.",,,,,,

While reactive methods like Artificial Potential Field (APF) offer simplicity and efficiency, they suffer from local minima, causing robots to become trapped due to their lack of global environmental awareness. Other existing solutions either rely on inter-robot communication, are limited to single-robot scenarios, or struggle to navigate nonconvex obstacles effectively.
Our proposed method enables collision-free navigation using only local sensor and state information without a map. By incorporating a wall-following (WF) behavior into the APF approach, our method allows robots to escape local minima, even in the presence of nonconvex and dynamic obstacles including other robots. We introduce two algorithms for switching between APF and WF: a rule-based system and an encoder network trained on expert demonstrations.

Coverage performance is measured using ergodicity, which when optimized balances exploitation versus exploration, where areas of interest are indicated with an information metric. Prior work uses spectral decomposition of a spatial map of information to guide a set of heterogeneous agents, each with different sensor and motion models, to optimize coverage. This work leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the information map rather than the Fourier transform typically applied to ergodic search and demonstrates the importance of selecting a suitable wavelet family to use, based on the information map being explored. Further a sequence of wavelets is used for decomposition to overcome dependency on selecting one suitable wavelet family. Our experimental results show that using wavelet families well-suited to the specific information map for information map decomposition leads to, on average, 43% improvement over a baseline method in terms of a standard coverage metric (ergodicity), while using a well-sequenced set of wavelets for decomposition leads to a 65% improvement in coverage performance across multiple types of information maps.",,,,,,

The minuscule volume of a cell (pL) and limited damping provided by the medium make it challenging to accurately and quickly aspirate a cell to the desired position inside the micropipette. Experienced clinicians intentionally insert an air segment inside the micropipette in advance to make the aspiration easier. Nevertheless, the unclear damping effects and the varying initial length of the air segment in each aspiration pose difficulties for most operators. Inadequate judgment and response may lead to overshoot or even loss of the cell. This paper constructs a nonlinear dynamics model to elucidate the cell motion inside a micropipette containing an inserted air segment. The model reveals the impact of the air segment. A model-based controller is designed to facilitate the accurate aspiration of human sperm to a desired position, incorporating an estimated initial length of the air segment. Experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of both the model and the controller involving various initial air segment lengths.

However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory.

Human-Robot Collaboration 2,Dynamic Collaborative Workspace Based on Human Interference Estimation for Safe and Productive Human-Robot Collaboration,"Kamezaki, Mitsuhiro;Wada, Tomohiro;Sugano, Shigeki","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Human-Centered Automation, Industrial Robots","Abstract: Collaborative robots that operate safely close to workers without fences have attracted attention, but few examples of such human-robot collaboration (HRC) have been seen in factories. The main reason is the difficulty in balancing safety and productivity. Current fenceless HRC systems stop the robot when a human enters the collaborative workspace (C) where both human and robot can work to ensure safety, which ISO/TS15066 regulates. The robot stops even when the human is far enough away, so productivity is drastically decreased (FCW, Fixed C). If a system could identify the human-work area, designate it as a no-entry space in C for the robot (C^P), and dynamically set the closed C (C^C) with shrinking C by C^P, productivity would improve thanks to enabling the robot to work in C^C and safety would be ensured thanks to allowing the human to continue working in C^P. In this study, we propose a new concept of a dynamic collaborative workspace (DCW) that dynamically sets C^C and C^P based on the humanÂ’s predicted trajectory. It also provides visual and auditory prompts to enable the human to understand DCW states, i.e., when a human enters C, C is changed, and the robot is in emergency mode. We compared four HRC systems using a real robot arm: two conventional FCW ones with and without fences and two proposed DCW ones with and without a state indicator and found that the proposed system with a state indicator has the best productivity and ensures the same level of safety as the conventional system with fences.",,,,,,

Multifingered Hands,Canonical Representation and Force-Based Pretraining of 3D Tactile for Dexterous Visuo-Tactile Policy Learning,"Wu, Tianhao;Li, Jinzhou;Zhang, Jiyao;Mingdong Wu, Aaron;Dong, Hao","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Multifingered Hands, Force and Tactile Sensing","Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a vital role in enabling robots to perform fine-grained, contact-rich tasks. However, the high dimensionality of tactile data, due to the large coverage on dexterous hands, poses significant challenges for effective tactile feature learning, especially for 3D tactile data, as there are no large standardized datasets and no strong pretrained backbones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel canonical representation that reduces the difficulty of 3D tactile feature learning and further introduces a force-based self-supervised pretraining task to capture both local and net force features, which are crucial for dexterous manipulation.

Tracking and Prediction 3,Dynamic Compact Consensus Tracking for Aerial Robots,"Sun, XiaoLou;Quan, Zhibin;Zhang, Feng;Li, Yuntian;Wang, Chunyan;Si, Wufei;Ni, Wenhui;Guan, Runwei;Wu, Yuan;Meng, Shen;Huang, YongMing","Keywords: Visual Tracking, Deep Learning Methods, Visual Learning","Abstract: Existing one-stream trackers have attracted widespread attention. However, they are not applicable in realtime UAV tracking systems due to substantial computational overhead, especially when dynamic templates are introduced. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dynamic Compact Consensus Tracker (DC2T), constructed by stacking modules that each consists of a Compact Token Encoder (CTE) and Dynamic Consensus Attention (DCA). Unlike traditional methods that convert images into a large number of tokens, the CTE, inspired by Â”superpixelÂ”, extracts a compact set of representative tokens from both initial and dynamic templates, eliminating the need for a large token set. This strategic reduction in the number of compact tokens markedly decreases the computational load of CTE, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent attention operations. To achieve near-linear complexity of the DCA, compact dynamic template tokens (as keys) are re-queried by search tokens (as queries) to perform dynamic consensus on the aggregated tokens (as values). This arrangement seamlessly incorporates dynamic spatio-temporal features into the DCA while avoiding the computational burden typically associated with dynamic templates. With the aim of further enhancing the systemÂ’s responsiveness and accuracy, a direct control network is crafted to seamlessly incorporate the prediction of high-level control values into the tracking network, ensuring a cohesive and efficient interaction with the controller. Comprehensive experiments and real-world evaluations have proven DC2TÂ’s superior performance, accompanied by a significant reduction in FLOPs. Furthermore, we have conducted experiments that demonstrate the trackerÂ’s ability to integrate seamlessly with other technologies such as SLAM and detection, enabling precise tracking of arbitrary objects.

While the integration of hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these issues, we in this paper introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which combines both explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing feature representation.

We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme.

However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data.

In early control iterations, the actions suggested by the DRL agent are adopted until the estimated real-time Jacobian approximates the actual deformation model. Subsequently, the independent Jacobian-based adaptive control (AC) with sufficient initial deformation awareness begins execution to achieve precise internal feature manipulation on deformable objects.

In this work, we present a novel 3D shape control approach that includes the physically realistic Cosserat model into a closedloop control framework, using vision feedback to rectify errors in real-time. This approach capitalizes on the advantages of both groups: the realism and precision provided by physics-based models, and the rapid computation, therefore enabling real-time correction of model errors, and robustness to elastic parameter estimation inherent in vision-based approaches.

Exploring smaller and narrower spaces allows for problems to be identified earlier, preventing negative outcomes for patients and equipment. The challenge is to scale down the navigation probe while preserving degrees of freedom (DOF) and functionality. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising probe candidates because they are solid-state, electrical-driven, and can be scaled down favorably. This work demonstrates a modular 2-DOF DEA miniature probe with an embedded CMOS sensor for visual data acquisition. The modularity achieved by a novel hinge system enables switching between single and dual DEA probes based on 2D or 3D pathway structures. The probes can be controlled using a pocket-sized circuit with two knobs to turn.

Soft Actuators 2,Stretchable Electrohydraulic Artificial Muscle for Full Motion Ranges in Musculoskeletal Antagonistic Joints,"Kazemipour, Amirhossein;Hinchet, Ronan;Katzschmann, Robert Kevin","Keywords: Soft Sensors and Actuators, Soft Robot Materials and Design, Compliant Joints and Mechanisms","Abstract: Artificial muscles play a crucial role in musculoskeletal robotics and prosthetics to approximate the force-generating functionality of biological muscle. However, current artificial muscle systems are typically limited to either contraction or extension, not both. This limitation hinders the development of fully functional artificial musculoskeletal systems. We address this challenge by introducing an artificial antagonistic muscle system capable of both contraction and extension. Our design integrates non-stretchable electrohydraulic soft actuators (HASELs) with electrostatic clutches within an antagonistic musculoskeletal framework. This configuration enables an antagonistic joint to achieve a full range of motion without displacement loss due to tendon slack. We implement a synchronization method to coordinate muscle and clutch units, ensuring smooth motion profiles and speeds. This approach facilitates seamless transitions between antagonistic muscles at operational frequencies of up to 3.2 Hz. While our prototype utilizes electrohydraulic actuators, this muscle-clutch concept is adaptable to other non-stretchable artificial muscles, such as McKibben actuators, expanding their capability for extension and full range of motion in antagonistic setups. Our design represents a significant advancement in the development of fundamental components for more functional and efficient artificial musculoskeletal systems, bringing their capabilities closer to those of their biological counterparts.",,,,,,

The careful implementation of the self-sensing method resulted in a small sensing resolution of 0.05 mm at a high actuation frequency of 20 Hz for a cylindrical DEA. Finally, the robot obtained a self-sensing odometry in a pipe, showing good consistency with the ground truth.

Soft Actuators 2,Intelligent Self-Healing Artificial Muscle: Mechanisms for Damage Detection and Autonomous Repair of Puncture Damage in Soft Robotics,"Krings, Ethan;McManigal, Patrick;Markvicka, Eric","Keywords: Soft Robot Materials and Design, Soft Sensors and Actuators, Soft Robot Applications","Abstract: Soft robotics are characterized by their high deformability, mechanical robustness, and inherent resistance to damage. These unique properties present exciting new opportunities to enhance both emerging and existing fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and exploration. However, to function effectively in unstructured environments, these technologies must be able to withstand the same real-world conditions that human skin and other soft biological materials are typically subjected to. Here, we present a novel soft material architecture designed for active detection of material damage and autonomous repair in soft robotic actuators. By integrating liquid metal (LM) microdroplets within a silicone elastomer, the system can detect and localize damage through the formation of conductive pathways that arise from extreme pressure or puncture events. These newly formed conductive networks function as in situ Joule heating elements, facilitating the reprocessing and healing of the material. The architecture allows for the reconfiguration of the newly formed electrical network using high current densities, employing electromigration and thermal mechanisms to restore functionality without manual intervention.

Soft Actuators 2,High-Force Electroadhesion Based on Unique Liquid-Solid Dielectrics for UAV Perching,"Luo, Junjie;Li, Jisen;Wang, Hongqiang;Zhu, Jian","Keywords: Soft Sensors and Actuators, Soft Robot Applications, Soft Robot Materials and Design","Abstract: Electroadhesion (EA), as an electrostatically driven, controllable adhesion technology, has unique attributes such as low noise, robust adaptability, and energy efficiency. However, its adhesion pressure is still low (0.1~10kPa) which may significantly limit its applications. This paper presents an innovative electroadhesion pad embedded with liquid and solid dielectrics. The experiments demonstrate that this liquid-solid electroadhesion pad (LSEAP) is capable of much larger adhesion pressure, compared to the traditional solid electroadhesion pad (SEAP). On one hand, the LSEAP can increase the dielectric contact with the substrate. On the other hand, the actuator can increase its dielectric strength. We also explore application of this actuator to perching of a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in order to promote the UAVÂ’s sustainable flight. Notably, the untethered LSEAP system, with an adhesion area as small as 4 cmÂ² and a self-weight as light as 8.7 g, can support a UAV of 249.7 g for stable adhesion on various surfaces. The adhesion pressure generated by our LSEAD can be 32.2kPa, significantly larger than those reported in the literature. The weight ratio of the UAV to the LSEAP system is 14.6, more than double those in the previous studies. The integration of this EA system markedly prolongs the operational duration of UAVs, rendering them suitable for sustainable surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This LSEAP also marks a pivotal advancement towards adhesion-based applications such as grippers and wall-climbing robots.",,,,,,

However, sea conditions, inffuenced by dynamic factors such as wave height, wind speed, and ocean currents, present a challenge in accurately assessing these conditions. Traditional classification models often assume accurate labels, but noisy labels are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as noise sample filtering or loss function adjustment, have limited applicability and poor generalization when dealing with complex sea condition data. To address this issue, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network model. The modelÂ’s feature extraction module uses deep representation learning to capture latent patterns in the data, and a loss function is designed to mitigate the impact of outliers. The integration of these components allows the model to perform accurate classification even in the presence of noisy labels.

Intelligent Transportation Systems and AI-Based Methods,Directed-CP: Directed Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Via Proactive Attention,"Tao, Yihang;Hu, Senkang;Fang, Zhengru;Fang, Yuguang","Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems, AI-Based Methods, Cooperating Robots","Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to expand an ego vehicleÂ’s field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods do expand the ego vehicleÂ’s 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, but faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Directed-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicleÂ’s directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training.

Our goal is to enable automated teaching via a learned model that interacts with the student similar to a human teacher. However, training such automated teaching systems is limited by the availability of high-quality annotated datasets of expert teacher and student interactions as they are difficult to collect at scale. To address this data scarcity problem, we propose an approach for training a coaching system for complex motor tasks such as high performance driving via a Multi-Task Imitation Learning (MTIL) paradigm.

Our method interprets human commands using a Large Language Model (LLM) and categorizes the instructions into navigation and behavioral guidelines. Navigation guidelines consist of directional commands (e.g., ""move forward until"") and associated landmarks (e.g., ""the building with blue windows""), while behavioral guidelines encompass regulatory actions (e.g., ""stay on"") and their corresponding objects (e.g., ""pavements""). We use VLMs for their zero-shot scene understanding capabilities to estimate landmark locations from RGB images for robot navigation. Further, we introduce a novel scene representation that utilizes VLMs to ground behavioral rules into a behavioral cost map. This cost map encodes the presence of behavioral objects within the scene and assigns costs based on their regulatory actions. The behavioral cost map is integrated with a LiDAR-based occupancy map for navigation. To navigate outdoor scenes while adhering to the instructed behaviors, we present an unconstrained Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based planner that prioritizes both reaching landmarks and following behavioral guidelines. We evaluate the performance of BehAV on a quadruped robot across diverse real-world scenarios, demonstrating a 22.49% improvement in alignment with human-teleoperated actions, as measured by FrÃ©chet distance, and achieving a 40% higher navigation success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,
State Estimation,An Adaptive Graduated Nonconvexity Loss Function for Robust Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions,"Jung, Kyungmin;Hitchcox, Thomas;Forbes, James Richard","Keywords: Graduated nonconvexity, Robust/Adaptive Control of Robotic Systems, SLAM, Learning and Adaptive Systems","Abstract: Many problems in robotics, such as estimating the state from noisy sensor data or aligning two point clouds, can be posed and solved as least-squares problems. Unfortunately, vanilla nonminimal solvers for least-squares problems are notoriously sensitive to outliers and initialization errors. The conventional approach to outlier rejection is to use a robust loss function, which is typically selected and tuned
a priori. A newly developed approach to handle large initialization errors is graduated nonconvexity (GNC), which is defined for a particular choice of a robust loss function. The main contribution of this paper is to combine these two approaches by using an adaptive kernel within a GNC optimization scheme. This produces least-squares problems that are robust to both outliers and initialization errors, without the need for model selection and tuning. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust compared to non-GNC counterparts and performs on par with other GNC-tailored loss functions. An Example code can be found at https://github.com/decargroup/gnc-adapt.",,,,,,
State Estimation,Learning Direct Solutions in Moving Horizon Estimation with Deep Learning Methods,"Lionti, Fabien;Gutowski, Nicolas;Aubin, SÃ©bastien;Martinet, Philippe","Keywords: Deep Learning Methods, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: State estimation in the context of dynamical systems is crucial for various applications, including control and monitoring. Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is an optimization-based state estimation algorithm that leverages a known dynamical model integrated over a moving horizon. The MHE optimization criterion corresponds to identify the initial state that best aligns the integrated trajectory with the system observation. In MHE setting, the state estimation performance increases with the considered length of the moving horizon but it can become computationally intensive which is a limiting factor for its applicability to fast-varying dynamical systems or on hardware with restricted computational power. Deep Learning (DL) methods can learn solutions to complex optimization problems without incurring any additional online computational cost beyond the inference of the considered architecture. In the context of state estimation we propose to study different type of DL architecture in order to provide full state estimation from partial and noisy system observations. The novel proposed method is based on an end-to-end differentiable formulation of the MHE optimization problem, enabling the offline training of a DL model to provide a state estimation that minimizes the MHE optimization criterion. Once training is completed, state estimations are generated through an explicit relationship learned by the DL model. The proposed method is compared to the online MHE formulation in various case studies, including scenarios with partially observed state and model discrepancies in the context of lateral vehicle dynamics. The results highlight improved state estimation performance both in terms of reduced computational time and accuracy with respect to the online MHE algorithm.",,,,,,

Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single-instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications.

RHTP has two unique characteristics: 1) an observe-first-and-manipulate-later (OFML) temporal constraint that forces a unique ordering of two different tasks for each target and 2) energy savings from efficient task collocation to minimize unnecessary movements. RHTP can be framed as a stochastic renewal process. According to the Renewal Reward Theorem, the expected energy usage per task cycle is the long-run average. Traditional task and motion planning focuses on feasibility rather than optimality due to the unknown object and obstacle position prior to execution. However, the known target/obstacle distribution in precision agriculture allows minimizing the expected energy usage. For each instance in this renewal process, we first compute task space partition, a novel data structure that computes all possibilities of task multiplexing and its probabilities with robot reachability. Then we propose a region-based set-coverage problem to formulate the RHTP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming. We have implemented and solved RHTP using Branch-and-Bound solver.

Agricultural Automation 1,Towards Closing the Loop in Robotic Pollination for Indoor Farming Via Autonomous Microscopic Inspection,"Kong, Chuizheng;Qiu, Alex;Wibowo, Idris;Ren, Marvin;Dhori, Aishik;Ling, Kai-Shu;Hu, Ai-Ping;Kousik, Shreyas","Keywords: Robotics and Automation in Agriculture and Forestry, Agricultural Automation, Automation at Micro-Nano Scales","Abstract: Effective pollination is a key challenge for indoor farming, since bees struggle to navigate without the sun. While a variety of robotic system solutions have been proposed, it remains difficult to autonomously check that a flower has been sufficiently pollinated to produce high-quality fruit, which is especially critical for self-pollinating crops such as strawberries. To this end, this work proposes a novel robotic system for indoor farming. The proposed hardware combines a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator arm with a custom end-effector, comprised of an endoscope camera, a 2-DOF microscope subsystem, and a custom vibrating pollination tool; this is paired with algorithms to detect and estimate the pose of strawberry flowers, navigate to each flower, pollinate using the tool, and inspect with the microscope. The key novelty is vibrating the flower from below while simultaneously inspecting with a microscope from above. Each subsystem is validated via extensive experiments.",,,,,,

Leveraging the recent notion of closed-loop state sensitivity, the proposed MPPI can consider the state sensitivity against parameter mismatch as a part of the system state, and consequently exploit this additional information to address the challenge of model mismatch in sampling-based model predictive control. Using an obstacle avoidance scenario, we demonstrate the use of our approach to control an aerial robot. We present an embedded implementation of our method, utilizing parallelization of computations on a GPU. Finally, we show the increased robustness of our approach over a standard MPPI controller through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and validate its embedded real-time properties.",,,,,,

The digital twin is built using closed-loop data acquired during standard BO iterations, and activated when the uncertainty in the Gaussian Process model of the optimization objective on the real system is high. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by our data-driven criteria related to the digital twin's uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters.",,,,,,

The proposed algorithm, called Stein Variational Differential Dynamic Programming, is a kernel-based extension of Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming that combines the best of the two worlds of sampling-based and gradient-based optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids known drawbacks of gradient-based dynamic optimization in terms of getting stuck at local minima, while it overcomes limitations of sampling-based stochastic optimization in terms of introducing undesirable stochasticity when applied in online fashion.

Koopman direct encoding (KDE) is a model-based approach that utilizes inner products and compositions in a Hilbert space to compute the Koopman operator. However, it has primarily been applied to autonomous systems and simulation environments. Here, we extend the application of KDE to nonautonomous systems and real-world environments by introducing Koopman direct encoding-based model predictive control (KDE-MPC). It was validated on nonlinear electromechanical systems with segmented dynamic conditions, such as contact-noncontact transitions, which pose challenges for modeling and control. Simulation results demonstrate a more stable and smoother position profile compared to proportional-integral-derivative control, particularly at discontinuous boundaries.

Optimization and Optimal Control,Effective Search for Control Hierarchies within the Policy Decomposition Framework,"Khadke, Ashwin;Geyer, Hartmut","Keywords: Optimization and Optimal Control, Evolutionary Robotics, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Policy decomposition is a novel framework for approximating optimal control policies of complex dynamical systems with a hierarchy of policies derived from smaller but tractable subsystems. It stands out amongst the class of hierarchical control methods by estimating a priori how well the closed-loop behavior of different control hierarchies matches the optimal policy. However, the number of possible
hierarchies grows prohibitively with the number of inputs and the dimension of the state-space of the system making it unrealistic to estimate the closed-loop performance for all hierarchies. Here, we present the development of two search methods based on Genetic Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Tree Search to tackle this combinatorial challenge, and demonstrate that it is indeed surmountable. We showcase the efficacy of our search methods and the generality of the framework by applying it towards finding hierarchies for control of three distinct robotic systems: a simplified biped, a planar manipulator, and
a quadcopter. The discovered hierarchies, in comparison to heuristically designed ones, provide improved closed-loop performance or can be computed in minimal time with marginally worse control performance, and also exceed the control performance of policies obtained with popular deep reinforcement learning methods.",,,,,,

Given natural language instructions, FrameCRL constructs an equivalent formal semantic formulation in the form of discourse representation structures (DRS). Imperative verbs are extracted from the semantic structures as keys to anchor relevant semantic frames from FrameNet, and the selected semantic frames are used to construct goal statements in planning language. Non-imperative statements are further analyzed to generate object specifications and the initial state of the planning problem. These generated statements are then merged into a single planning script, which can be solved directly by the integrated planner.

However, existing policies continue to struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios, considering that the action data remains notoriously hard to collect. While fine-tuning offers a practical way to quickly adapt a GMP to novel domains and tasks with limited samples, we observe that the performance of the resulting GMP differs significantly with respect to the design choices of fine-tuning strategies. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth empirical study to investigate the effect of key factors in GMP fine-tuning strategies, covering the action space, policy head, and the choice of tunable parameters, where over 2,500 rollouts are evaluated for a single configuration. We systematically discuss and summarize our findings and identify the key design choices, which we believe give a practical guideline for GMP fine-tuning.

Learning Based Planning for Manipulation 2,Routing Manipulation of Deformable Linear Object Using Reinforcement Learning and Diffusion Policy,"Li, Mingen;Yu, Houjian;Choi, Changhyun","Keywords: Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Tasks involving deformable linear objects (DLOs) are prevalent in daily life but pose significant challenges due to their infinite degrees of freedom and underactuated nature. Frequent contact between DLOs and surrounding objects with unknown physical parameters, such as friction, further complicates their manipulation. Performing tasks like routing ropes through a hole requires gentle yet robust manipulation, making it particularly challenging. Previous research has not adequately addressed general DLO manipulation tasks that involve intensive contact, especially in environments with rough surfaces. This paper presents a robust and delicate manipulation learning approach for the DLO routing task, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and diffusion policy. First, reinforcement learning agents are trained separately for rope insertion and pulling. During training, the agents are encouraged to minimize rope tension throughout task execution in environments with randomized friction to achieve delicate motion. Next, the rollouts from these agents are collected as expert demonstrations to train a diffusion policy. Our approach generates delicate motions to prevent the rope from being damaged or getting stuck on rough surfaces while remaining robust against environmental disturbances.

To address these challenges, we, for the first time, propose a single-view RGB-D-based depth completion framework, TransDiff, that leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPM) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in desktop. Specifically, we leverage features extracted from RGB images, including semantic segmentation, edge maps, and normal maps, to condition the depth map generation process. Our method learns an iterative denoising process that transforms a random depth distribution into a depth map, guided by initially refined depth information, ensuring more accurate depth estimation in scenarios involving transparent objects. Additionally, we propose a novel training method to better align the noisy depth and RGB image features, which are used as conditions to refine depth estimation step by step.
Finally, we utilized an improved inference process to accelerate the denoising procedure. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with acceptable inference time.

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings.

Existing methods introduce various priors to guide 3D lane prediction, which generally consist of a series of reference points for context aggregation. However, due to the misalignment between these reference points and the lanes, it is difficult to obtain complete and discriminative context for complex instances. In this paper, we are devoted to introducing 3D priors adaptive to lane appearances, which serve as references to aggregate the lane context. Specifically, we propose a projection-consistent reference generation strategy to keep the projected 3D reference points geometrically consistent with the corresponding lanes in images. In addition, a segmentation-lifting denoising strategy is designed to improve the ability of the model to map the lane segmentation into 3D space. To leverage more lane-related information, we propose a decoupled lane-context aggregation module by considering the perspectives of individual geometries and integrated layout, namely intra-lane and inter-lane context.

Consequently, researchers have increasingly turned towards vehicle re-identification (reID) techniques to bridge the gap between cross-view camera systems. Despite the growing interest, one major challenge persists: the scarcity of authentic, large-scale training datasets. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline designed to synthesize high-fidelity vehicle data, thereby facilitating subsequent vehicle representation learning.

Recent
advancements in dense mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces
two challenges, including incom- plete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this

Interactive Robot Learning,Personalizing Interfaces to Humans with User-Friendly Priors,"Christie, Benjamin;Nemlekar, Heramb;Losey, Dylan","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Probabilistic Inference, Virtual Reality and Interfaces","Abstract: Robots often need to convey information to human users. For example, robots can leverage visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces to display their intent or express their internal state. In some scenarios there are socially agreed upon conventions for what these signals mean: e.g., a red light indicates an autonomous car is slowing down. But as robots develop new capabilities and seek to convey more complex data, the meaning behind their signals is not always mutually understood: one user might think a flashing light indicates the autonomous car is an aggressive driver, while another user might think the same signal means the autonomous car is defensive. In this paper we enable robots to adapt their interfaces to the current user so that the human's personalized interpretation is aligned with the robot's meaning. We start with an information theoretic end-to-end approach, which automatically tunes the interface policy to optimize the correlation between human and robot. But to ensure that this learning policy is intuitive --- and to accelerate how quickly the interface adapts to the human --- we recognize that humans have priors over how interfaces should function. For instance, humans expect interface signals to be proportional and convex. Our approach biases the robot's interface towards these priors, resulting in signals that are adapted to the current user while still following social expectations. Our simulations and user study results across 15 participants suggest that these priors improve robot-to-human communication. See videos here: https://youtu.be/Re3OLg57hp8.",,,,,,

However, existing practices often require training a personalized robot policy from scratch, resulting in inefficient use of human feedback. In this paper, we propose preference-based action representation learning (PbARL), an efficient fine-tuning method that decouples common task structure from preference by leveraging pre-trained robot policies. Instead of directly fine-tuning the pre-trained policy with human preference, PbARL uses it as a reference for an action representation learning task that maximizes the mutual information between the pre-trained source domain and the target user preference-aligned domain. This approach allows the robot to personalize its behaviors while preserving original task performance and eliminates the need for extensive prior information from the source domain, thereby enhancing efficiency and practicality in real-world HRI scenarios.

To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.",,,,,,

Applying learning-based methods to address mobile robot tasks has gained popularity due to its robustness and generalizability. Traditional methods such as Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer adaptability but require large datasets, carefully crafted reward functions, and face sim-to-real gaps, making them challenging for efficient and safe real-world deployment. We propose an online human-in-the-loop learning method PVP4Real that combines IL and RL to address these issues. PVP4Real enables efficient real-time policy learning from online human intervention and demonstration, without reward or any pretraining, significantly improving data efficiency and training safety. We validate our method by training two different robots---a legged quadruped, and a wheeled delivery robot---in two mobile robot tasks, one of which even uses raw RGBD image as observation. The training finishes {within 15 minutes}. Our experiments show the promising future of human-in-the-loop learning in addressing the data efficiency issue in real-world robotic tasks.

To address this, we introduce Janus, a hybrid blimp-drone platform equipped with integrated balloon failure detection and recovery capability. Janus employs a triggered mechanism that seamlessly transitions the platform from a blimp to a standard quad-rotor drone. Utilizing multiple sensors and fusing their readings, we have developed a robust balloon failure detection system. Janus demonstrates omnidirectional mobility in blimp mode and transitions promptly into quadrotor mode upon receiving the signal. Our results affirm the successful recovery of the system from balloon failure, with a rapid response time of 66ms to balloon failure detection. The drone morphs into a quadrotor and achieves recovery within 0.362 seconds in 90% of cases. By amalgamating the enduring flight capabilities of blimps with the agility of quad-rotors within a morphing platform like Janus, we cater to applications demanding both prolonged flight duration and enhanced agility.",,,,,,
Mechanism Design 3,A Novel Passive Parallel Elastic Actuation Principle for Load Compensation in Legged Robots,"Zhang, Yifang;Jiang, Jingcheng;Tsagarakis, Nikos","Keywords: Mechanism Design, Actuation and Joint Mechanisms","Abstract: This work introduces a novel parallel elastic actuation principle designed to provide torque compensation for legged robots. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed concept leverages a nitrogen N2 gas spring combined with a cam roller module to generate a highly customizable torque compensation profile for the target leg joint. An optimization-based design approach is employed to derive the specifications of the gas spring and optimize the cam module to produce a compensation torque profile closest to the desired one. The proposed load compensation concept and related mechanism are experimentally evaluated and practically integrated into the knee joint of a two-DoF monopedal robot actuated by cycloid actuators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed principle can effectively generate the required compensation torque profile and achieve significant benefits for the prototyped monopedal robot system by reducing 71.92% of the additional energy consumption caused by the payload. The entire system is compact, easy to integrate, and highly customizable, enabling the creation of nonlinear torque compensation profiles as needed.

The passive closed model is formed by connecting seven rigid frames via seven viscoelastic joints, and the active open model is formed by connecting them via actuated joints. The former is a convex heptagonal model and can exhibit passive-dynamic rolling on a gentle downhill, whereas the latter virtually forms a forward-leaning octagonal shape by controlling the six relative joint angles. In the first half of this paper, we describe the model assumptions and develop the mathematical equations of motion and collision of the passive closed model, and numerically analyze the motion characteristics by changing the slope angle while checking the conditions necessary for stable motion generation.

Mechanism Design 3,Poloidal Drive: Direct-Drive Transmission Mechanism for Active Omni-Wheels with Spoke Interference Avoidance,"Sano, Shunsuke;Tadakuma, Kenjiro;Kayawake, Ryotaro;Watanabe, Masahiro;Abe, Kazuki;Kemmotsu, Yuto;Tadokoro, Satoshi","Keywords: Mechanism Design, Wheeled Robots","Abstract: Wheels require extra space for steering. Omnidirectional wheels are ideal for confined spaces as they can move in all directions: forward/backward and left/right. Conventional omnidirectional wheels with passive rollers achieve this movement by combining multiple wheels. However, if even one wheel loses contact with the ground, the vehicle becomes inoperable. To overcome this limitation, omnidirectional wheels with actively driven rollers have been proposed. These designs, however, require additional components, which increase weight. This is because multi-step intermediate transmission mechanisms are needed to convert spindle rotation into roller rotation. Eliminating the intermediate transmission mechanism reduces the number of components and provides more space to enhance wheel strength. This study proposed a mechanism without intermediate transmission, clarified its design framework, and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility as an active omnidirectional wheel. The proposed design framework defines conditions to maximize both power transmission efficiency and strength. Experimental results showed that the transmission efficiency of the proposed mechanism is comparable to that of conventional mechanisms.",,,,,,

The accuracy of the integrated location and orientation depends on the precision of the uncertainty modeling. Traditional methods of uncertainty modeling typically assume a Gaussian distribution and involve manual heuristic parameter tuning. However, these methods struggle to scale effectively and address long-tail scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based method that encodes sensor information using higher-order neural network features, thereby eliminating the need for uncertainty estimation. This method significantly eliminates the need for parameter fine-tuning by developing an end-to-end neural network that is specifically designed for multi-sensor fusion.

The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions.

The new type of pretouch dual-modality distance and material sensor (PDM^2) can provide reliable and accurate depth readings, but it is a point sensor and scanning the object exclusively with the sensor is too inefficient. Hence, we present a sensor fusion approach by combining a regular camera with the PDM^2 sensor. The approach is based on a data fusion algorithm for shape reconstruction and an active perception algorithm for scan planning for the PDM^2 sensor. The data fusion algorithm is a distributed Gaussian process (GP)-based shape reconstruction method that allows for incremental local update to reduce computational time. The active perception algorithm is an optimization-based approach by increasing the information gain (IG) and prioritizing the boundary points under a preset travel distance constraint. We have implemented and tested the algorithms with six different transparent household items.

Existing control strategies for AMs often regard the manipulator as a disturbance and employ robust control methods to mitigate its influence. This research focuses on elevating the precision of the end effector and enhancing the agility of aerial manipulator movements. We present a composite control scheme to address these challenges. Initially, a Nonlinear Disturbance Observer (NDOB) is utilized to compensate for internal coupling effects and external disturbances. Subsequently, manipulator dynamics are processed through a high pass filter to facilitate agile movements.

The advances in flapping technology recently led to the prototyping of leg-claw mechanisms for perching and occasionally very lightweight arms for sampling or tiny object aerial manipulation. A dual-arm manipulator on top of a robotic bird might not be bio-inspired and safe in case of a collision with the environment or human-robot interaction. Here in this work, the previously designed dual-arm scissors-type manipulator has been improved in terms of workspace, mechanism, vision system, and blade placement to present a more natural way of sampling.

Our approach centers on a safety filter that dynamically adjusts the desired trajectory of the vehicle's pose, accounting for the aerial manipulator's dynamics, the disturbance observer's structure, and motor thrust limits. We provide rigorous proof that the proposed safety filter ensures the forward invariance of the safety setÂ—representing motor thrust limitsÂ—even in the presence of disturbance estimation errors. To demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing control strategies for aerial physical interaction, we perform comparative experiments involving complex tasks, such as pushing against a static structure and pulling a plug firmly attached to an electric socket.

Particularly when dealing with heavy objects, the powerful propellers of the drone can inadvertently blow the target object away as it approaches, making the task even more difficult. To address these challenges, we introduce SPIBOT, a novel drone-tethered mobile gripper system designed for robust and stable autonomous target retrieval. SPIBOT operates via a tether, much like a spider, allowing the drone to maintain a safe distance from the target. To ensure both stable mobility and secure grasping capabilities, SPIBOT is equipped with six legs and sensors to estimate the robot's and mission's states. It is designed with a reduced volume and weight compared to other hexapod robots, allowing it to be easily stowed under the drone and reeled in as needed.

This system integrates a real-time action selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts the robot's actions based on proximity to the mission goal and environmental conditions, enabling rapid and robust mission execution. Experimental results across various terrains, including a pontoon on a lake, a grass field, and rubber mats on coastal sand, demonstrate SPIBOT's ability to efficiently and reliably retrieve targets.

Vision-Based Navigation 3,Knowledge-Driven Visual Target Navigation: Dual Graph Navigation,"Li, Shiyao;Meng, Ziyang;Pei, JianSong;Chen, Jiahao;Dong, BingCheng;Li, Guangsheng;Liu, Shenglan;Wang, Feilong","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Semantic Scene Understanding, Robotics in Under-Resourced Settings","Abstract: In unknown environments, navigating a robot by a given image to a specific location or instance is critical and challenging. The existing end-to-end approaches require simultaneous implicit learning of multiple subtasks, and modular approaches depend on metric information. Both approaches face high computational demands, often leading to difficulties in real-time updates and limited generalization, making them challenging to implement on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Graph Navigation (DGN), a knowledge-driven, lightweight image instance navigation framework. DGN builds an External Knowledge Graph (EKG) from small-scale datasets to capture prior object correlations, efficiently guiding target exploration. During exploration, DGN builds an Internal Knowledge Graph (IKG) using an instance-aware module, which records explored objects based on reachability relationships rather than precise metric information. The IKG dynamically updates the EKG, enhancing the robot's adaptability to the current environment. Together, they realize topological perception and reduce computational overhead. Furthermore, unlike approaches characterized by over-dependence between components, DGN employs a plug-and-play modular design that allows independent training and flexible replacement of functional modules, effectively enhancing generalization performance while reducing training and deployment costs. Experiments illustrate that DGN generalizes well in different simulation environments (AI2-THOR, Habitat), achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProcTHOR-10K dataset. It is compatible with three distinct real-world robot platforms, including edge computing devices without CUDA support. It exhibits a decision-making speed of 3.8 to 5.5 times over baseline methods.

Due to the complex and dynamic nature of this task, existing approaches typically rely on sophisticated pipelines that separately process perception and decision-making to solve it.

The Obstruction Distance Vector (ODV) is an intermediate representation in our model, leveraged to describe the Obstruction Distance to the first future collision in all possible directions in the horizontal field of view. As ODV cannot be calculated directly in the real world, we design a neural network for ODV estimation, formulating it as a classification problem with auxiliary proxy tasks, which play a key role in effectively predicting the implicit future motion of nearby humans. Taking advantage of ODV, ODVEEM supervised by human behavioral heuristics is employed to guide the agent to reach a goal efficiently and avoid potential collisions.

Classical approaches struggle with cluttered settings and require extensive tuning, while learning-based methods face difficulties generalizing to out-of-distribution environments. This paper introduces xmobility{}, an end-to-end generalizable navigation model that overcomes existing challenges by leveraging three key ideas. First, xmobility{} employs an auto-regressive world modeling architecture with a latent state space to capture world dynamics. Second, a diverse set of multi-head decoders enables the model to learn a rich state representation that correlates strongly with effective navigation skills. Third, by decoupling world modeling from action policy, our architecture can train effectively on a variety of data sources, both with and without expert policiesÂ—off-policy data allows the model to learn world dynamics, while on-policy data with supervisory control enables optimal action policy learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that xmobility{} not only generalizes effectively but also surpasses current state-of-the-art navigation approaches.

To tackle this, we propose Map-Semantic Zero-shot Navigation (Map-SemNav), which does not rely on large models for navigation planning. Map-SemNav utilizes three key cues: direction, object, and scene, to acquire relational knowledge instead of memorizing specific classes, which enables generalization to unseen data. Direction is guided by a top-down semantic map, while object and scene information is decoupled from environment knowledge.

It relies on a subset of navigable free space from the robot to a gap, denoted the keyhole region. The region is defined by the union of the largest collision-free disc centered on the robot and a collision-free trapezoidal region directed through the gap. Safer Gap first generates Bezier-based collision-free paths within the keyhole regions. The keyhole region of the top scoring path is encoded by a shallow neural network-based zeroing barrier function (ZBF) synthesized in real-time. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Keyhole ZBF constraints and output tracking of the Bezier path, synthesizes a safe kinematically feasible trajectory. The Potential Gap projection operator serves as a last action to enforce safety if the NMPC optimization fails to converge to a solution within the prescribed time.

Marine Robotics 4,Diver to Robot Communication Underwater,"Codd-Downey, Robert;Jenkin, Michael","Keywords: Marine Robotics, Gesture, Posture and Facial Expressions, Human-Robot Collaboration","Abstract: Gesture-based communication is a standard underwater communication strategy that is taught to divers as part of their regular diver training and it would seem a natural mechanism to leverage for diver to robot communication underwater. Enabling an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to understand such sequences would involve having the robot learn the large set of gestures that divers use and the way they are combined. As perfect transcription of gestures is unlikely, the communication process also requires an error-correcting framework to ensure that communication is clear and correct. Here we describe an interactive process that provides this infrastructure. A weakly supervised transfer learning approach is used to recognize standard SCUBA gestures in individual video frames and within a Sim2Real process to train a LSTM to recognize gesture sequences. This process is placed within a per-gesture and per-sequence interaction process to assist and confirm the recognition of individual gestures and to confirm entire gesture sequences. Individual aspects of this process and complete end-to-end operation are demonstrated using an unmanned underwater vehicle.",,,,,,
Marine Robotics 4,SIMP: Energy and Time-Efficient Real-Time 3D Motion Planning for Bio-Inspired AUVs,"BjÃ¸rlo, August Sletnes;Xanthidis, Marios;FÃ¸re, Martin;Kelasidi, Eleni","Keywords: Marine Robotics, Collision Avoidance, Biologically-Inspired Robots","Abstract: Underwater navigation is an area of increasing research interest due to its fundamental complexity and industrial applications. Though, due to convenience and current theoretical understanding, the vast majority of underwater platforms utilize thrusters, while other forms of propulsion, such as undulation locomotion, have been given limited exposure. This paper provides the first real-time motion planning framework that produces energy and time efficient paths with empirical local optimality for articulated swimming robots in 3D, called SIMP. SIMP utilizes learned associations between parameterized dynamically feasible undulatory gaits with their expected energy cost, velocity, and swept-out volume of the robot during execution, to formulate a simplified optimization problem that decides the path to be followed with the corresponding consecutive gaits, and navigates the robot safely in complex 3D environments. The proposed pipeline is tested in numerical experiments with realistic dynamics for a 10-link underwater snake robot (USR) with anguilliform gaits, in simulated cluttered environments of significant challenge, displaying real-time replanning performance of more than 1 Hz.",,,,,,

However, underwater multi-view stereo (UwMVS) faces substantial challenges arising from the domain gap between in-air and underwater environments, leading to degraded performance when applying in-air MVS models to underwater scenarios. Furthermore, the progress of learning-based UwMVS methods has been hindered by the scarcity of underwater multi-view images with ground-truth depth maps and point clouds. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a physically-guided approach for synthesizing underwater multi-view images and present the first large-scale UwMVS dataset for end-to-end training and evaluation of learning-based UwMVS methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel UwMVS network that enhances geometric cue encoding to achieve more accurate and complete point cloud reconstruction.

We propose an underwater robust monocular visual odometry (UR-MVO) pipeline tailored for underwater scenarios with feature extraction and matching based on SuperPoint and SuperGlue models, respectively. We enhance the robustness of the feature extractor through field-specific fine-tuning of the SuperPoint model using few-shot unsupervised learning. This tuning was done on real images of underwater scenes in order to enhance its performance in the harsh underwater image conditions. Moreover, we integrate semantic segmentation trained on underwater images into our pipeline to eliminate unreliable features belonging to dynamic objects and background. We evaluated the proposed solution on the Aqualoc dataset, demonstrating higher localization accuracy compared to other SOTA direct and feature-based monocular VO methods like DSO and SVO and also obtained very competitive results compared to more resource-intensive monocular VSLAM approaches with loop closure process like LDSO, UVS, and ORB-SLAM.

Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium.

Based on these factors, we compute the appropriate robot gait to maximize stability, which leads to reduced energy consumption. Our approach can also be used to predict imminent crashes in challenging terrains and execute behaviors to preemptively avoid them.

However, previous work on low-cost quadruped robots with egocentric vision systems has been limited by a narrow front-facing view and exteroceptive noise, restricting omnidirectional mobility in such environments. While building a voxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing, it introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this paper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of multi-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D environments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with the robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion, enabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the direction of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies on proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all these skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese network structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the robot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view. Experiments in both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the robustness of our method, broadening the operational environments for robotics with egocentric vision.",,,,,,

This paper presents a Quality-Diversity framework to generate diverse and challenging terrains that uncover weaknesses in legged robot controllers. Our method, applied to both simulated bipedal and quadruped robots, produces an archive of terrains optimized to challenge the controller in different ways. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the generated archive effectively contains terrains that the robots struggled to traverse, presenting different failure modes. Interesting results were observed, including failure cases that were not necessarily expected. Experiments show that the generated terrains can also be used to improve RL-based controllers.",,,,,,

Following a design modification tailored to the controller, the robot is able to reproduce its passive gait even on level-ground. The results are verified via independent high-fidelity physics simulations of the real robot's digital twin.

While leg-wheel robots take advantage of having both legged and wheeled modes, their ability to negotiate stairs still requires careful planning. This paper presents a novel approach to developing a stair-climbing behavior for leg-wheel transformable robots. A comprehensive stair-climbing strategy is constructed by analyzing the workspace of the leg-wheel mechanism, considering the position of the robotÂ’s center of mass, and accounting for foothold displacement owing to the possible leg-wheel forward rolling motion. This strategy enables the robot to safely navigate stairs using its leg-wheel's appropriate parts. Stability during transitions between steps is ensured, and an optimized swing trajectory is proposed to minimize slippage and impact. The approach is validated through simulations and further tested experimentally on staircases with treads of 27 cm and risers of 12 cm, as well as staircases with treads of 24 cm and risers of 14 cm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",,,,,,

Geometric Foundations,RM4D: A Combined Reachability and Inverse Reachability Map for Common 6-/7-Axis Robot Arms by Dimensionality Reduction to 4D,"Rudorfer, Martin","Keywords: Kinematics, Mobile Manipulation, Industrial Robots","Abstract: Knowledge of a manipulatorÂ’s workspace is fundamental for a variety of tasks including robot design, grasp planning and robot base placement. Consequently, workspace representations are well studied in robotics. Two important representations are reachability maps and inverse reachability maps. The former predicts whether a given end-effector pose is reachable from where the robot currently is, and the latter suggests suitable base positions for a desired end-effector pose. Typically, the reachability map is built by discretizing the 6D space containing the robotÂ’s workspace and determining, for each cell, whether it is reachable or not. The reachability map is subsequently inverted to build the inverse map. This is a cumbersome process which restricts the applications of such maps. In this work, we exploit commonalities of existing six and seven axis robot arms to reduce the dimension of the discretization from 6D to 4D. We propose Reachability Map 4D (RM4D), a map that only requires a single 4D data structure for both forward and inverse queries. This gives a much more compact map that can be constructed by an order of magnitude faster than existing maps, with no inversion overheads and no loss in accuracy. Finally, we showcase the efficiency gains by applying RM4D for finding suitable base positions in a scenario with 800 target grasps.",,,,,,
Geometric Foundations,An Average-Distance Minimizing Motion Sweep for Bounded Spatial Objects and Its Application in BÂ´ezier-Like Freeform Motion Generation,"Liu, Huan;Ge, Qiaode","Keywords: Kinematics, Motion and Path Planning, Motion Control","Abstract: This paper uses the ellipsoidal parameters associated with volume moments of inertia of a bounded solid object to construct a motion sweep joining two poses of the solid object, in contrast to earlier works on motion interpolation in SE(3) without taking into account the shape of the moving object. The paper borrows the concept of shape-dependent object norms introduced by Kazerounian and Rastegar and refined by Chirikjian and Zhou to compute as a metric the average of the squared distances (or ASD) among all homologous points of the bounded body between two given poses and seeks to obtain an optimal interpolating motion that minimizes a combination of two ASD distances from each intermediate pose to the two given poses. It is found that the ASD minimizing motion sweep is a novel straight-line motion such that while the centroid of the object follows a straight line, the orientation of the object is constrained so that the ASD metric is minimized. Furthermore, the rotational component can be determined by polar decomposition of the linearly interpolated rotation matrices, scaled by the object's inertia parameters. As an illustration of one of its applications, this motion sweep is repeatedly applied using the de Casteljau algorithm to generate BÃ©zier-like freeform motions, whose paths are in general dependent on the shape of the inertia ellipsoid.",,,,,,
Geometric Foundations,Geometric Static Modeling Framework for Piecewise-Continuous Curved-Link Multi Point-Of-Contact Tensegrity Robots,"Ervin, Lauren;Vikas, Vishesh","Keywords: Kinematics, Space Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Tensegrities synergistically combine tensile (cable) and rigid (link) elements to achieve structural integrity, making them lightweight, packable, and impact resistant. Consequently, they have high potential for locomotion in unstructured environments. This research presents geometric modeling of a Tensegrity eXploratory Robot (TeXploR) comprised of two semi-circular, curved links held together by 12 prestressed cables and actuated with an internal mass shifting along each link. This design allows for efficient rolling with stability (e.g., tip-over on an incline). However, the unique design poses static and dynamic modeling challenges given the discontinuous nature of the semi-circular, curved links, two changing points of contact with the surface plane, and instantaneous movement of the masses along the links. The robot is modeled using a geometric approach where the holonomic constraints confirm the experimentally observed four-state hybrid system, proving TeXploR rolls along one link while pivoting about the end of the other. It also identifies the quasi-static state transition boundaries that enable a continuous change in the robot states via internal mass shifting. This is the first time in literature a non-spherical two-point contact system is kinematically and geometrically modeled. Furthermore, the static solutions are closed-form and do not require numerical exploration of the solution. The MATLABÂ® simulations are experimentally validated on a tetherless prototype with mean absolute error of 4.36Â° for the arc angles of the points of contact.",,,,,,
Geometric Foundations,GISR: Geometric Initialization and Silhouette-Based Refinement for Single-View Robot Pose and Configuration Estimation,"Bilic, Ivan;Maric, Filip;Bonsignorio, Fabio;Petrovic, Ivan","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Visual Learning, AI-Enabled Robotics","Abstract: In autonomous robotics, measurement of the robotÂ’s internal state and perception of its environment, including interaction with other agents such as collaborative robots, are essential. Estimating the pose of the robot arm from a single view has the potential to replace classical eye-to-hand calibration approaches and is particularly attractive for online estimation and dynamic environments. In addition to its pose, recovering the robot configuration provides a complete spatial understanding of the observed robot that can be used to anticipate the actions of other agents in advanced robotics use cases. Furthermore, this additional redundancy enables the planning and execution of recovery protocols in case of sensor failures or external disturbances. We introduce GISR - a deep configuration and robot-to-camera pose estimation method that prioritizes execution in real-time. GISR consists of two modules: (i) a geometric initialization module that efficiently computes an approximate robot pose and configuration, and (ii) a deep iterative silhouette-based refinement module that arrives at a final solution in just a few iterations. We evaluate GISR on publicly available data and show that it outperforms existing methods of the same class in terms of both speed and accuracy, and can compete with approaches that rely on ground-truth proprioception and recover only the pose.

Multi-Robot Path Planning 3,Stop-N-Go: Search-Based Conflict Resolution for Motion Planning of Multiple Robotic Manipulators,"Han, Gidon;Park, Jeongwoo;Nam, Changjoo","Keywords: Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Multi-Robot Systems, Cooperating Robots","Abstract: We address the motion planning problem for multiple robotic manipulators in packed environments where shared workspace can result in goal positions occupied or blocked by other robots unless those other robots move away to make the goal positions free. While planning in a coupled configuration space (C-space) is straightforward, it struggles to scale with the number of robots and often fails to find solutions. Decoupled planning is faster but frequently leads to conflicts between trajectories.
We propose a conflict resolution approach that inserts pauses into individually planned trajectories using an A*search strategy to minimize the makespan--the total time until all robots complete their tasks. This method allows some robots to stop, enabling others to move without collisions, and maintains short distances in the C-space. It also effectively handles cases where goal positions are initially blocked by other robots.

Experiments show that cNKZ dramatically outperforms baseline approaches, which cannot find solutions at all. We integrate cNKZ with a sampling-based motion planning algorithm to generate complex, coordinated motions for 3--6 mobile manipulators (18--36 DoF), with cNKZ solving up to 80 nonlinear constraints simultaneously and achieving up to a 92% success rate in cluttered environments.

In (near)-optimally solving MRPP, as serial computation approaches its efficiency limits, parallelization offers a promising route to extend that limit further. As a single solution is unlikely to be successful in addressing all settings, e.g., in handling small/hard or large/sparse MRPP instances, in this study, we explore a targeted parallelization effort to boost the performance of conflict-based search for MRPP. Specifically, when instances are relatively small but robots are densely packed with strong interactions, we devise a decentralized parallel algorithm that concurrently explores multiple branches that leads to markedly enhanced solution discovery. On the other hand, for large problems with sparse robot-robot interactions, we find that prioritizing node expansion and conflict resolution more promising. Our innovative multi-threaded approach to parallelizing bounded-suboptimal conflict search-based algorithms demonstrates significant improvements over baseline serial methods in success rate or runtime. Our work furthers the understanding of MRPP and charts a promising path for elevating solution quality and computational efficiency through parallel algorithmic strategies.",,,,,,

The proposed method efficiently handles static, suddenly appearing, and dynamic obstacles, maintaining consistent computational performance across diverse scenarios. To achieve this, two key challenges must be addressed. First, the substantial volume of pixel and depth map data requires robust, real-time processing for efficient D-CBF construction. Second, constructing D-CBFs for each obstacle in multi-obstacle scenarios increases optimization solver time. To address these challenges, we adapt the concept of salient object detection (SOD), proposing an enhanced FastSOD (E-FastSOD) method for rapid risk area identification. This approach rapidly filters out low-risk areas, while high-risk regions are mathematically represented utilizing the proposed enhanced minimal bounding circle (E-MBC) technique. We differentiate static and dynamic obstacles by comparing current and previous MBC states, employing Kalman filtering for obstacle state prediction. This setup enables efficient online D-CBF construction for each MBC, balancing computational speed with accurate obstacle representation. Subsequently, the second filter establishes buffer zones around established D-CBFs, activating only those corresponding to zones the robot actually enters, rather than all D-CBFs to increase real-time performance. We prove the system's safety and asymptotic stabilization under this architecture. Simulated and real-world experiments validate our method, demonstrating an equipped mobile robot's ability to accomplish tasks while ensuring safety across diverse, unknown scenarios.",,,,,,

Safety Index Synthesis (SIS) deeply relies on the system dynamics and once the dynamics change, the previously synthesized safety index becomes invalid. In this work, we show the real-time efficacy of Safety Index Adaptation (SIA) in varying dynamics. SIA enables real-time adaptation to the changing dynamics so that the adapted safe control law can still guarantee 1) forward invariance within a safe region and 2) finite time convergence to that safe region. This work employs SIA on a package-carrying quadruped robot, where the payload weight changes in real-time. SIA updates the safety index when the dynamics change, e.g., a change in payload weight, so that the quadruped can avoid obstacles while achieving its performance objectives. Numerical study provides theoretical guarantees for SIA and a series of hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SIA in real-world deployment in avoiding obstacles under varying dynamics.",,,,,,
Safe Control 2,Updating Robot Safety Representations Online from Natural Language Feedback,"Santos, Leonardo;Li, Zirui;Peters, Lasse;Bansal, Somil;Bajcsy, Andrea","Keywords: Robot Safety, AI-Enabled Robotics, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: Robots must operate safely when deployed in novel and human-centered environments, like homes. Current safe control approaches typically assume that the safety constraints are known a priori, and thus, the robot can pre-compute a corresponding safety controller. While this may make sense for some safety constraints (e.g., avoiding collision with walls by analyzing a floor plan), other constraints are more complex (e.g., spills), inherently personal, context-dependent, and can only be identified at deployment time when the robot is interacting in a specific environment and with a specific person (e.g., fragile objects, expensive rugs). Here, language provides a flexible mechanism to communicate these evolving safety constraints to the robot. In this work, we use vision language models (VLMs) to interpret language feedback and the robotÂ’s image observations to continuously update the robotÂ’s representation of safety constraints. With these inferred constraints, we update a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability safety controller to efficiently update the robot controller to ensure ongoing safety.

Safe Control 2,Distributed Perception Aware Safe Leader Follower System Via Control Barrier Methods,"Suganda, Richie Ryulie;Tran, Tony;Pan, Miao;Fan, Lei;Lin, Qin;Hu, Bin","Keywords: Robot Safety, Multi-Robot Systems, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: This paper addresses a distributed leader-follower formation control problem for a group of agents, each using a body-fixed camera with a limited field of view (FOV) for state estimation. The main challenge arises from the need to coordinate the agentsÂ’ movements with their camerasÂ’ FOV to maintain visibility of the leader for accurate and reliable state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perception-aware distributed leader-follower safe control scheme that incorporates FOV limits as state constraints. A Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program is employed to ensure the forward invariance of a safety set defined by these constraints. Furthermore, new neural network based and double bounding boxes based estimators, combined with temporal filters, are developed to estimate system states directly from real-time image data, providing consistent performance across various environments. Comparison results in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in two distinct environments.",,,,,,
Human-Robot Interaction 4,Gesturing towards Efficient Robot Control: Exploring Sensor Placement and Control Modes for Mid-Air Human-Robot Interaction,"Mielke, Tonia;Heinrich, Florian;Hansen, Christian","Keywords: Design and Human Factors, Virtual Reality and Interfaces, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: While collaborative robots effectively combine robotic precision with human capabilities, traditional control methods such as button presses or hand guidance can be slow and physically demanding. This has led to an increasing interest in natural user interfaces that integrate hand gesture-based interactions for more intuitive and flexible robot control. Therefore, this paper systematically explores mid-air robot control by comparing position and rate control modes with different state-of-the-art and novel sensor placements. A user study was conducted to evaluate each combination in terms of accuracy, task duration, perceived workload, and physical exertion. Our results indicate that position control is more efficient than rate control. Traditional desk-mounted sensors can provide a good balance between accuracy and comfort. However, robot-mounted sensors are a viable alternative for short-term, accurate control with less spatial requirements. Leg-mounted sensors, while comfortable, pose challenges to hand-eye coordination. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for improving the usability and comfort of mid-air human-robot interaction. Future research should extend this evaluation to a wider range of tasks and environments.",,,,,,

However, due to the differences in human and robot movement characteristics, a human expert might unintentionally demonstrate an action that the robot cannot execute. We propose feasibility-aware behavior cloning from observation (FABCO). In the FABCO framework, the feasibility of each demonstration is assessed using the robot's pre-trained forward and inverse dynamics models. This feasibility information is provided as visual feedback to the demonstrators, encouraging them to refine their demonstrations. During policy learning, estimated feasibility serves as a weight for the demonstration data, improving both the data efficiency and the robustness of the learned policy.

Previous studies have predominantly employed rigid grippers to perform the handover, focusing their efforts on the generation of grasps that avoid physical contact with people. In this paper, instead, we present a vision-based open-palm handover solution where a soft robotic hand exploits on purpose the contact with the human hand for improved grasp success and robustness. In particular, the human-robot physical interaction allows the robotic hand to slide over the human palm surface and firmly cage the object. The identification of the human hand plane and the object pose is achieved through a versatile perception pipeline that exploits a single RGB-D camera. Through several experimental trials we show that the system achieves successful grasps over multiple objects with different geometries and textures. We also conduct a comparative analysis between the proposed soft handover method and a baseline approach, evaluating their robustness to uncertainties on the object position.

Asraf;Ozkan-Aydin, Yasemin","Keywords: Soft Robot Applications, Biologically-Inspired Robots, Soft Sensors and Actuators","Abstract: Soft robots can adapt to their environments, which makes them suitable for deploying in disaster areas and agricultural fields, where their mobility is constrained by complex terrain. One of the main challenges in developing soft terrestrial robots is that the robot must be soft enough to adapt to its environment, but also rigid enough to exert adequate force on the ground to locomote. In this letter, we report a pneumatically driven, soft modular appendage made of silicone for a terrestrial robot capable of generating specific mechanical movement to locomote in the desired direction. We used Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations to assess the soft legÂ’s bending behavior, validated against the physical leg. In addition, we performed blocked force analysis to understand its force generation capabilities. We developed a soft-rigid- bodied tethered robot prototype and tested it on the ground and underwater environments to evaluate its locomotion performance. The robot demonstrated successful forward and backward movement as well as left and right turns, both on the ground and underwater. We explored the object manipulation and transportation capability of the robot by adding two additional soft appendages as a gripper.

However, they often suffer from limitations in grasping force. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel pneumatic three-finger soft gripper to achieve robust adaptive grasping. The gripper consists of three identical fingers, each containing a pneumatic bending soft actuator and a pneumatic lateral soft actuator. The bending actuator features a tilted pneumatic network structure, which provides superior bending performance compared to traditional vertical pneumatic network structure. The lateral actuator is equipped with three deflection chambers at the finger root to mimic the lateral motions of a human finger. Kinematic and static models are established to predict the bending angle and grasping force of the soft finger under pressurized air. The performance of the proposed soft finger is analyzed through finite element simulations, and the effect of the chamber tilt angle is also examined. The theoretical and simulation results are compared to verify the validity of the analytical models. Finally, the proposed soft gripper is fabricated by 3D printing and molding.

This design significantly reduces the actuation force needed for larger elastic deformations, particularly when dealing with harder materials like thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The incorporation of two helically routed tendons within the finger enables both in-plane bending and lateral out-of-plane transitions, effectively expanding its workspace and allowing for variable curvature along its length. Compliance analysis indicates that the compliance at the fingertip can be fine-tuned by adjusting the mounting placement of the fingers. This customization enhances the gripper's adaptability to a diverse range of objects. By leveraging TPU's substantial elastic energy storage capacity, the gripper is capable of dynamically rotating objects at high speeds, achieving approximately 60Â° in just 15 milliseconds.

Soft Robotic Grasping 2,Improving Grip Stability Using Passive Compliant Microspine Arrays for Soft Robots in Unstructured Terrain,"Ervin, Lauren;Bezawada, Harish;Vikas, Vishesh","Keywords: Compliant Joints and Mechanisms, Soft Robot Materials and Design, Field Robots","Abstract: Microspine grippers are small spines commonly found on insect legs that reinforce surface interaction by engaging with asperities to increase shear force and traction. An array of such microspines, when integrated into the limbs or undercarriage of a robot, can provide the ability to maneuver uneven terrains, traverse inclines, and even climb walls. Meanwhile, the conformability and adaptability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates for applications involving traversal of complex, unstructured terrains. However, there remains a real-life realization gap for soft locomotors pertaining to their transition from controlled lab environment to the field that can be bridged by improving grip stability through effective integration of microspines. In this research, a passive, compliant microspine stacked array design is proposed to enhance the locomotion capabilities of mobile soft robots. A microspine array integration method effectively addresses the stiffness mismatch between soft, compliant, and rigid components. Additionally, a reduction in complexity results from actuation of the surface-conformable soft limb using a single actuator. The two-row, stacked microspine array configuration offers improved gripping capabilities on steep and irregular surfaces. This design is incorporated into three different robot configurations - the baseline without microspines and two others with different combinations of microspine arrays. Field experiments are conducted on surfaces of varying surface roughness and non-uniformity - concrete, brick, compact sand, and tree roots. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of microspine arrays increases planar displacement an average of 10 times. The improved grip stability, repeatability, and, terrain traversability is reflected by a decrease in the relative standard deviation of the locomotion gaits.",,,,,,

Soft robots address these difficulties, but the compliance which gives them their inherent safety also limits their ability to apply desired forces. Jamming/locking reduces this back-drivability but does not allow for directional application of force. We present a hybrid system including pneumatic and tendon actuation as well as a system of cable-driven locking modules, able lock individual joints. Combining these mechanisms yields a device which can behave as: a soft finger, a fully-rigid finger, and a locally-locking finger which mimics a traditional rigid-link robot. This finger is able to switch between these behaviors on-the-fly, allowing it to adapt to unexpected scenarios, critical for social robots. Using these modes and the ability to adapt real-time, our finger is able to complete common household tasks, difficult for current robots. We characterize the fingerÂ’s ability to resist force in three actuation modes (Pneumatic, Cable, and Locked), its ability to apply force, and its ability to actuate in 31 different configurations (plus a static all-locked configuration). We also present a demonstration in which the finger conforms to the shape of a computer mouse then clicks a mouse button, and of the finger conforms to the shape of a heavy door handle, then pulling it open.

This study explores emergent decentralized rotation in the Loopy multicellular robot, composed of homogeneous, physically linked, 1-degree-of-freedom cells. Inspired by biological systems like sunflowers, Loopy uses simple local interactionsÂ—diffusion, reaction, and active transport of simulated chemicals, called morphogensÂ—without centralized control or knowledge of its global morphology. Through these interactions, the robot self-organizes to achieve coordinated rotational motion and forms lobesÂ—local protrusions created by clusters of motor cells. This study investigates how these interactions drive LoopyÂ’s rotation, the impact of its morphology, and its resilience to actuator failures. Our findings reveal two distinct behaviors: 1) inner valleys between lobes rotate faster than the outer peaks, contrasting with rigid body dynamics, and 2) cells rotate in the opposite direction of the overall morphology. The experiments show that while LoopyÂ’s morphology does not affect its angular velocity relative to its cells, larger lobes increase cellular rotation and decrease morphology rotation relative to the environment. Even with up to one-third of its actuators disabled and significant morphological changes, Loopy maintains its rotational abilities, highlighting the potential of decentralized, bio-inspired strategies for resilient and adaptable robotic systems.",,,,,,

However, it is common practice in imitation learning for cameras to be fixed in place, resulting in issues like occlusion and limited field of view. Furthermore, cameras are often placed in broad, general locations, without an effective viewpoint specific to the robot's task. In this work, we investigate the utility of active vision (AV) for imitation learning and manipulation, in which, in addition to the manipulation policy, the robot learns an AV policy from human demonstrations to dynamically change the robot's camera viewpoint to obtain better information about its environment and the given task. We introduce AV-ALOHA, a new bimanual teleoperation robot system with AV, an extension of the ALOHA 2 robot system, incorporating an additional 7-DoF robot arm that only carries a stereo camera and is solely tasked with finding the best viewpoint. This camera streams stereo video to an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing the operator to control the camera pose using head and body movements.

Grasping 2,Trajectory Optimization for Dynamically Grasping Irregular Objects,"Vu, Minh Nhat;Grander, Florian;Nguyen, Anh;Unger, Christoph","Keywords: Industrial Robots, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: This paper presents a novel trajectory optimization framework for grasping a thin object with the schunk (SDH2) hand-mounted on a Kuka robot. Unlike a conventional grasping task, we aim to achieve a ``dynamic grasp'' of the object, which requires continuous movement during the grasping process. The trajectory framework comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of SI{10}{second}, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real time within 100 milliseconds. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework.

To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to explore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the depth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the correlation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we propose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which distillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Specifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block (PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the corresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence between two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student branch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains the reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the consistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth completion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from the teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the distance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a higher speed of 48 FPS. In addition, the significant improvement in a real-world robotic grasping system illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed system.",,,,,,
Grasping 2,Real-Time Grasp Quality in Boundary-Constrained Granular Swarm Robots,"Mulroy, Declan;CaÃ±ones Bonham, David Francesc;Spenko, Matthew;Srivastava, Ankit","Keywords: Grasping, Swarm Robotics, Motion Control","Abstract: Soft robotic grippers offer advantages over rigid end effectors but are typically coupled to a rigid robot for locomotion. In contrast, this paper details a soft robot for both locomotion and grasping. The system is a type of boundary- constrained granular swarm robot, which is composed of a closed-loop series of active (capable of locomotion) sub-robots. Prior work has shown how this type of robot is capable of loco- motion and grasping. For this paper, we propose a new grasping strategy and demonstrate real-time grasp quality evaluation using pressure sensors and the Ferrari-Canny grasp metric. The grasping strategy leverages gradient-based control via distance functions and dynamic system planning to achieve desired robot geometries for effective grasping. Previous research primarily used pull tests to evaluate grasping efficacy, which lacked real- time feedback on grasp quality. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this method.",,,,,,
Grasping 2,Learning Dual-Arm Coordination for Grasping Large Flat Objects,"Wang, Yongliang;Kasaei, Hamidreza","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Bimanual Manipulation, Dual Arm Manipulation","Abstract: Grasping large flat objects, such as books or keyboards lying horizontally, presents significant challenges for single-arm robotic systems, often requiring extra actions like pushing objects against walls or moving them to the edge of a surface to facilitate grasping. In contrast, dual-arm manipulation, inspired by human dexterity, offers a more refined solution by directly coordinating both arms to lift and grasp the object without the need for complex repositioning. In this paper, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable dual-arm coordination for grasping large flat objects. We utilize a large scale grasp pose detection model as a backbone to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then used as the state representation in a reinforcement learning (RL) model. A CNN-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with shared Actor-Critic layers is employed to learn coordinated dual-arm grasp actions. The system is trained and tested in Isaac Gym and deployed to real robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our policy can effectively grasp large flat objects without requiring additional maneuvers. Furthermore, the policy exhibits strong generalization capabilities, successfully handling unseen objects. Importantly, it can be directly transferred to real robots without fine-tuning, consistently outperforming baseline methods.",,,,,,
Grasping 2,QDGset: A Large Scale Grasping Dataset Generated with Quality-Diversity,"Huber, Johann;HÃ©lÃ©non, FranÃ§ois;Kappel, Mathilde;PÃ¡ez Ubieta, Ignacio de Loyola;Gil, Pablo;Puente, Santiago;Ben Amar, Faiz;Doncieux, StÃ©phane","Keywords: Grasping, Data Sets for Robot Learning, Evolutionary Robotics","Abstract: Recent advances in AI have led to significant results in robotic learning, but skills like grasping remain partially solved. Many recent works exploit synthetic grasping datasets to learn to grasp unknown objects. However, those datasets were generated using simple grasp sampling methods using priors. Recently, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proven to make grasp sampling significantly more efficient. In this work, we extend QDG-6DoF, a QD framework for generating object-centric grasps, to scale up the production of synthetic grasping datasets. We propose a data augmentation method that combines the transformation of object meshes with transfer learning from previous grasping repertoires. The conducted experiments show that this approach reduces the number of required evaluations per discovered robust grasp by up to 20%. We used this approach to generate QDGset, a dataset of 6DoF grasp poses that contains about 3.5 and 4.5 times more grasps and objects, respectively, than the previous state-of-the-art. Our method allows anyone to easily generate data, eventually contributing to a large-scale collaborative dataset of synthetic grasps.",,,,,,
Grasping 2,Patch Tree: Exploiting the Gauss Map and Principal Component Analysis for Robotic Grasping,"Jia, Yan-Bin;Xue, Yuechuan;Tang, Ling","Keywords: Grasping, In-Hand Manipulation","Abstract: Grasp planning must consider an object's local geometry (at the finger contacts), for the range of applicable wrenches under friction, and its global geometry, for force closure and grasp quality. Most everyday objects have curved surfaces unamenable to a pure combinatorial approach but treatable with tools from differential geometry. Our idea is to ``discretize'' such a surface in a top-down fashion into elementary patches (e-patches), each consisting of points that would yield close enough wrenches. Preprocessing based on Gaussian curvature decomposes the surface into strictly convex, strictly concave, ruled, and saddle patches. The Gauss map guides the subdivision of any patch with a large variation in the contact force direction, with the aid of a Platonic solid. The principal component analysis (PCA) further subdivides any patch that has a large variation in torque. The final structure is called a {it patch tree}, which stores e-patches at its leaves, and force or torque ranges at its internal nodes. Grasp synthesis and optimization operates on the patch tree with a stack to efficiently prune away non-promising finger placements. Simulation and experiment with a Shadow Hand have been conducted over everyday items. The patch tree exhibits different levels of surface granularity. It has a good promise for efficient planning of finger gaits to carry out grasping and tool manipulation.",,,,,,
Localization 4,Improved Bag-Of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for Ground Texture Localization,"Wilhelm, Aaron;Napp, Nils","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Mapping","Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate k-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.",,,,,,
Localization 4,Improving Indoor Localization Accuracy by Using an Efficient Implicit Neural Map Representation,"Kuang, Haofei;Pan, Yue;Zhong, Xingguang;Wiesmann, Louis;Behley, Jens;Stachniss, Cyrill","Keywords: Localization, Mapping, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Globally localizing a mobile robot in a known map is often a foundation for enabling robots to navigate and operate autonomously. In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization.

Localization 4,Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles,"Wu, Qiyuan;Campbell, Mark","Keywords: Localization, Sensor Fusion, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs. highway, dynamic vs. static scenes, winter vs. summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.",,,,,,
Localization 4,LiLoc: Lifelong Localization Using Adaptive Submap Joining and Egocentric Factor Graph,"Fang, Yixin;Li, Yanyan;Qian, Kun;Tombari, Federico;Wang, Yue;Lee, Gim Hee","Keywords: Localization, Mapping, SLAM","Abstract: This paper proposes a versatile graph-based lifelong localization framework, LiLoc, which enhances its timeliness by maintaining a single central session while improves the accuracy through multi-modal factors between the central and subsidiary sessions. First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods. Our codes will be publicly available on https://github.com/Yixin-F/LiLoc.",,,,,,
Localization 4,ReFeree: Radar-Based Lightweight and Robust Localization Using Feature and Free Space,"Kim, Hogyun;Choi, Byunghee;Choi, Euncheol;Cho, Younggun","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Field Robots","Abstract: Place recognition plays an important role in achieving robust long-term autonomy. Real-world robots face a wide range of weather conditions (e.g. overcast, heavy rain, and snowing) and most sensors (i.e. camera, LiDAR) essentially functioning within or near-visible electromagnetic waves are sensitive to adverse weather conditions,making reliable localization difficult. In contrast, radar is gaining traction due to long electromagnetic waves, which are less affected by environmental changes and weather independence. In this work, we propose a radar-based lightweight and robust place recognition. We achieve rotational invariance and lightweight by selecting a one-dimensional ring-shaped description and robustness by mitigating the impact of false detection utilizing opposite noise characteristics between free space and feature. In addition, the initial heading can be estimated, which can assist in building a SLAM pipeline that combines odometry and registration, which takes into account onboard computing. The proposed method was tested for rigorous validation across various scenarios (i.e. single session, multi-session, and different weather conditions). In particular, we validate our descriptor achieving reliable place recognition performance through the results of extreme environments that lacked structural information such as an OORD dataset.",,,,,,
Localization 4,On the Consistency of Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization: A Transformation-Based Approach,"Hao, Ning;He, Fenghua;Tian, Chungeng;Hou, Yi","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: This paper investigates the inconsistency problem caused by the mismatch of observability properties commonly found in multi-robot cooperative localization (CL) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). To address this issue, we propose a transformation-based approach that introduces a linear time-varying transformation to ensure the transformed system possesses a state-independent unobservable subspace. Consequently, its observability properties remain unaffected by the linearization points. We establish the relationship between the unobservable subspaces of the original and transformed systems, guiding the design of the time-varying transformation. We then present a novel estimator based on this method, referred to as the Transformed EKF (T-EKF), which utilizes the transformed system for state estimation, thereby ensuring correct observability and thus consistency. The proposed approach has been extensively validated through both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating better performance in terms of both accuracy and consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,

Software Tools 2,Introducing KUGE: A Simultaneous Control Co-Design Architecture and Its Application to Aerial Robotics Development,"Wauters, Jolan;Lefebvre, Tom;Crevecoeur, Guillaume","Keywords: Methods and Tools for Robot System Design, Optimization and Optimal Control, Aerial Systems: Applications","Abstract: The increasing complexity of tasks performed by hybrid aerial robotic systems, such as tail-sitters, demands a more integrated approach to their design. Traditional sequential design methods fall short because they separate the control system design from the conceptual design, limiting the potential for discovering coupled solutions. This disjointed process constrains the design space, making it difficult to optimize both the control performance and system dynamics simultaneously. In response to this limitation, there has been growing interest in mission-specific dynamic design procedures, which aim to address specific operational challenges by integrating control and design early in the development process. The multi-disciplinary approach of control co-design (CCD) expands the design space by solving control and system design problems concurrently. The recently introduced DAIMYO framework demonstrated that combining multi-fidelity modelling with a nested CCD approach can tackle the sim-to-real gap. However, DAIMYOÂ’s reliance on Bayesian optimization to account for the computational cost increase of a nested formulation limits its scalability. To address these issues, we propose KUGE, a simultaneous CCD strategy that reduces computational complexity and overcomes dimensionality restrictions through a combined effort of stochastic optimization and Gaussian processes. We validate the effectiveness of KUGE by applying it to the dynamic design of a tail-sitter, showing that it is competitive with the DAIMYO architecture while offering greater computational efficiency.",,,,,,

While such facilities can offer realistic scenarios post an MCI that can serve training and educational purposes for first responders and humanitarian robots, they are often hard to access owing to logistical constraints. To overcome this challenge, we present HEROES- a versatile Unreal Engine-based simulator for designing novel training simulations for humans and emergency robots for such urban search and rescue operations. The proposed HEROES simulator is capable of generating synthetic datasets for machine learning pipelines that are used for training robot navigation.

Current robotics middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 faces challenges with nondeterminism and high communication latency when dealing with large data across multiple subscribers on a multi-core compute platform. To address these issues, we present High-Performance Robotic Middleware (HPRM), built on top of the deterministic coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). HPRM employs optimizations including an in-memory object store for efficient zero-copy transfer of large payloads, adaptive serialization to minimize serialization overhead, and an eager protocol with real-time sockets to reduce handshake latency.

Additionally, a functionally optimal design may not always be the most practical to build and practicality cannot always be captured by an objective function. By defining and learning the optimal design manifold, which represents the space of all optimal solutions, we provide a systematic method for exploring the design space and selecting the most practical optimal design.

System Design,Monotone Subsystem Decomposition for Efficient Multi-Objective Robot Design,"Wilhelm, Andrew;Napp, Nils","Keywords: Methods and Tools for Robot System Design, Optimization and Optimal Control, Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Automating design minimizes errors, accelerates the design process, and reduces cost. However, automating robot design is challenging due to recursive constraints, multiple design objectives, and cross-domain design complexity possibly spanning multiple abstraction layers. Here we look at the problem of component selection, a combinatorial optimization problem in which a designer, given a robot model, must select compatible components from an extensive catalog. The goal is to satisfy high-level task specifications while optimally balancing trade-offs between competing design objectives. In this paper, we extend our previous constraint programming approach to multi-objective design problems and propose the novel technique of monotone subsystem decomposition to efficiently compute a Pareto front of solutions for large-scale problems. We prove that subsystems can be optimized for their Pareto fronts and, under certain conditions, these results can be used to determine a globally optimal Pareto front. Furthermore, subsystems serve as an intuitive design abstraction and can be reused across various design problems. Using an example quadcopter design problem, we compare our method to a linear programming approach and demonstrate our method scales better for large catalogs, solving a multi-objective problem of 10^25 component combinations in seconds. We then expand the original problem and solve a task-oriented, multi-objective design problem to build a fleet of quadcopters to deliver packages. We compute a Pareto front of solutions in seconds where each solution contains an optimal component-level design and an optimal package delivery schedule for each quadcopter.",,,,,,

Human-Aware Robot Motion,Sampling-Based Grasp and Collision Prediction for Assisted Teleoperation,"Manschitz, Simon;GÃ¼ler, Berk;Ma, Wei;Ruiken, Dirk",Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation,"Abstract: Shared autonomy allows for combining the global planning capabilities of a human operator with the strengths of a robot such as repeatability and accurate control. In a real-time teleoperation setting, one possibility for shared autonomy is to let the human operator decide for the rough movement and to let the robot do fine adjustments, e.g., when the view of the operator is occluded. We present a learning-based concept for shared autonomy that aims at supporting the human operator in a real-time teleoperation setting. At every step, our system tracks the target pose set by the human operator as accurately as possible while at the same time satisfying a set of constraints which influence the robotÂ’s behavior. An important characteristic is that the constraints can be dynamically activated and deactivated which allows the system to provide task-specific assistance. Since the system must generate robot commands in real-time, solving an optimization problem in every iteration is not feasible. Instead, we sample potential target configurations and use Neural Networks for predicting the constraint costs for each configuration. By evaluating each configuration in parallel, our system is able to select the target configuration which satisfies the constraints and has the minimum distance to the operatorÂ’s target pose with minimal delay. We evaluate the framework with a pick and place task on a bi-manual setup with two Franka Emika Panda robot arms with Robotiq grippers.",,,,,,

However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors---a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.",,,,,,

Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer othersÂ’ behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot.

We design the network structure, observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.",,,,,,

Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a generative diffusion model. The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction, avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Human-Aware Robot Motion,Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction Using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs,"Gorlo, Nicolas;Schmid, Lukas M.;Carlone, Luca","Keywords: Human and Humanoid Motion Analysis and Synthesis, Datasets for Human Motion, Long term Interaction","Abstract: We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.",,,,,,
Robot Foundation Models 2,LUMOS: Language-Conditioned Imitation Learning with World Models,"Nematollahi, Iman;DeMoss, Branton;L Chandra, Akshay;Hawes, Nick;Burgard, Wolfram;Posner, Ingmar","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: We introduce LUMOS, a language-conditioned multi-task imitation learning framework for robotics. LUMOS learns skills by practicing them over many long-horizon rollouts in the latent space of a learned world model and transfers these skills zero-shot to a real robot. By learning on-policy in the latent space of the learned world model, our algorithm mitigates policy-induced distribution shift which most offline imitation learning methods suffer from. LUMOS learns from unstructured play data with fewer than 1% hindsight language annotations but is steerable with language commands at test time. We achieve this coherent long-horizon performance by combining latent planning with both image- and language-based hindsight goal relabeling during training, and by optimizing an intrinsic reward defined in the latent space of the world model over multiple time steps, effectively reducing covariate shift. In experiments on the difficult long-horizon CALVIN benchmark, LUMOS outperforms prior learning-based methods with comparable approaches on chained multi-task evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn a language-conditioned continuous visuomotor control for a real-world robot within an offline world model.

However, robots capable of performing multiple tasks can be much more valuable in real-world applications. Multi-task reinforcement learning can be very challenging due to the increased sample complexity and the potentially conflicting task objectives. Previous work on this topic is dominated by model-free approaches. The latter can be very sample inefficient even when learning specialized single-task agents. In this work, we focus on model-based multi-task reinforcement learning. We propose a method for learning multi-task visual world models, leveraging pre-trained language models to extract semantically meaningful task representations. These representations are used by the world model and policy to reason about task similarity in dynamics and behavior.

Robot Foundation Models 2,Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling Via Large Language Models for Robotic Skill Learning,"Huang, Changxin;Liang, Junyang;Chang, Yanbin;Xu, Jingzhao;Li, Jianqiang","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy optimization is inefficient and limits the robotÂ’s learning performance. To address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner. Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.",,,,,,

Existing representations such as language, goal images, and trajectory sketches have been shown to be helpful, but these representations either do not provide enough context or provide over-specified context that yields less robust policies. We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the pose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet lightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate efficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our method, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an affordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this affordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge heterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot trajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain affordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any additional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks how RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and we empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.

Several independent efforts have shown that given sufficient training data in an environment, robot policies can generalize to demonstrated variations in that environment. However, needing to finetune robot models to every new environment stands in stark contrast to models in language or vision that can be deployed zero-shot for open-world problems. In this work, we present Robot Utility Models (RUMs), a framework for training and deploying zero-shot robot policies that can directly generalize to new environments without any finetuning. To create RUMs efficiently, we develop new tools to quickly collect data for mobile manipulation tasks, integrate such data into a policy with multi-modal imitation learning, and deploy policies on-device on Hello Robot Stretch, a cheap commodity robot, with an external mLLM verifier for retrying. We train five such utility models for opening cabinet doors, opening drawers, picking up napkins, picking up paper bags, and reorienting fallen objects. Our system, on average, achieves 90% success rate in unseen, novel environments interacting with unseen objects. Moreover, the utility models can also succeed in different robot and camera set-ups with no further data, training, or fine-tuning.

Imitation Learning 2,XMoP: Whole-Body Control Policy for Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Neural Motion Planning,"Rath, Prabin Kumar;Gopalan, Nakul","Keywords: Learning from Demonstration, Whole-Body Motion Planning and Control, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: Classical manipulator motion planners work across different robot embodiments. However they plan on a pre-specified static environment representation, and are not scalable to unseen dynamic environments. Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and zero-shot transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on 7 commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average 70% success rate on baseline benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate sim-to-real deployment on two unseen manipulators solving novel planning problems across three real-world domains even with dynamic obstacles.",,,,,,

In this paper, we propose KALM, a framework that leverages large pre-trained vision-language models (LMs) to automatically generate task-relevant and cross-instance consistent keypoints. KALM distills robust and consistent keypoints across views and objects by generating proposals using LMs and verifies them against a small set of robot demonstration data.

However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature ""single-outcome"", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors.

Parking operations often suffer from limited space and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks.

However, a major drawback of existing driving policies derived from imitation learning is their proneness to capturing spurious correlations, owing to the lack of an explicit causal model. Deploying such policies in unpredictable real-world environments poses severe risks, as spurious correlations may result in flawed decisions that compromise safety. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach called Multi-Task Invariant Representation Imitation Learning (MIRIL). MIRIL combines invariant learning with imitation learning to identify cross-environment invariant causal representations from driving demonstrations in various scenarios. These representations are then fed into multiple downstream branches for multi-task learning, including policy learning, perception prediction, invariant representation learning, and transition dynamics learning. Through the multi-task learning approach, the model not only makes consistent driving decisions across different environments but also perceives the vehicle's surroundings, thereby improving adaptability and robustness in diverse driving conditions. This enables MIRIL to effectively handle a wide range of driving scenarios, ensuring safety and efficiency. Supported by clear metrics, this paper details our comprehensive experimental setup, including datasets, benchmarks, and comparative analyses, underscoring the capability of MIRIL to significantly boost system generalization and excel in decision-making significantly.",,,,,,

We introduce DISC, one of the first datasets designed to capture various driving styles & behaviors in pre-crash scenarios for mixed autonomy analysis. DISC includes over 8 classes of driving styles/behaviors from hundreds of drivers navigating a simulated vehicle through a virtual city, encountering rare-event traffic scenarios. This dataset enables the classification of pre-crash human driving behaviors in unsafe conditions, supporting individualized trajectory prediction based on observed driving patterns. It offers the potential to improve autonomous vehicle safety by accounting for diverse human driving behaviors in stressful traffic & rare accident scenarios, which are otherwise difficult or risky to capture. By utilizing a VR-based driving simulator, TRAVERSE, data was collected through a driver-centric study involving human drivers encountering 12 simulated accident scenarios. This dataset fills a critical gap in human-centric driving data for rare events involving interactions with autonomous vehicles. It enables autonomous systems to better react to human drivers & optimize trajectory prediction in mixed autonomy environments involving both human-driven & self-driving cars. It includes essential data such as acceleration, braking & vehicle pose providing a foundation for machine-learning models in autonomous vehicles. In addition, individual driving behaviors are classified through a set of standardized questionnaires, carefully designed to identify & categorize driving behavior. We correlate data features with driving behaviors, showing that the simulated environment reflects real-world driving styles.

Autonomous Vehicles 1,Real-World Automated Vehicle Longitudinal Stability Analysis: Controller Design and Field Test,"Ma, Ke;Zhang, Yuqin;Zhou, Hang;Liang, Zhaohui;Li, Xiaopeng","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Integrated Planning and Control, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: Although extensive research has been conducted on modeling the stable longitudinal controller of automated vehicles (AVs) to dampen traffic oscillations, the real-world performance of these controllers in actual vehicles remains uncertain. In the operation of real-world AVs, the delay between actual dynamics and the commands prevents the controller's command from being effectively implemented to dampen traffic oscillations. Thus, this study adapts the designed controllers within an AV test platform to compare the theoretically stable conditions with the actual oscillation dampening performance. Initially, we compute the stable conditions for both the traditional car-following controller, which assumes no delay, and the longitudinal controller that accounts for the dynamic response of the vehicle. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that the longitudinal controller predicts vehicle stability more accurately than conventional car-following controller, showing an improvement from an average prediction accuracy rate of 0.59 to 0.91. Also, the experiments uncover specific delays inherent in dynamics systems, with a response delay of 0.34 seconds. Our work makes two principal contributions to the field of AV control systems. First, it empirically validates that the longitudinal model, which accounts for the vehicle's dynamic responses, offers a more precise representation of vehicular behavior. Second, the relatively brief response delay identified expands the stability region, thereby enhancing vehicle control and safety. The longitudinal controller is critical for enhancing AV performance and reliability in dampening traffic oscillations.",,,,,,

Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes.

To enhance scene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that combines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob, improving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather than individual rays to better capture the scene structure.

This approach calculates Gaussians to generate rendering loss flows for each environmental component based on a designed photometric-geometric loss function. To distinguish and filter environmental disturbances, we iteratively analyze rendering loss flows to detect features characterized by changes in loss values between dynamic objects and static components.

A commonly used approach is learning-based decision-making, such as reinforcement learning (RL). However, most existing safe RL methods suffer from two limitations: (i) they assume accurate state information, and (ii) safety is generally defined over the expectation of the trajectories. It remains challenging to design optimal coordination between multi-agents while ensuring hard safety constraints under system state uncertainties (e.g., those that arise from noisy sensor measurements, communication, or state estimation methods) at every time step. We propose a safety guaranteed hierarchical coordination and control scheme called Safe-RMM to address the challenge. Specifically, the high-level coordination policy of CAVs in mixed traffic environment is trained by the Robust Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (RMAPPO) method. Though trained without uncertainty, our method leverages a worst-case Q network to ensure the model's robust performances when state uncertainties are present during testing. The low-level controller is implemented using model predictive control (MPC) with robust Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety through their forward invariance property.

The assumed solution concept influences the behaviors of two interacting players in racing. For example, blocking behavior emerges naturally in leader-follower play, but to achieve this in Nash play the costs would have to be chosen specifically to trigger this behavior. In this work, we develop a novel model for competitive two-player vehicle racing, represented as an equilibrium problem, complete with simplified aerodynamic drag and drafting effects, as well as position-dependent collision-avoidance responsibility.

However, most research primarily focuses on the aggressive flight of a single quadrotor, simplifying the racing gate traversal problem to a waypoint passing problem that neglects the orientations of the racing gates {or implicitly considers the waypoint direction during path planning}. In this paper, we propose a systematic method called Pairwise Model Predictive Control (PMPC) that can guide two quadrotors online to navigate racing gates with minimal time and without collisions. The flight task is initially simplified as a point-mass model waypoint passing problem to provide time optimal reference through an efficient two-step velocity search method.

To address varying gate orientations, we introduce a novel Magnetic Induction Line-based spatial curve to guide the quadrotors through racing gates of different orientations. Furthermore, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem that uses the point-mass trajectory as initial values and references to enhance solving efficiency. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments.

To make these radial velocities observable, we modified the firmware of a commercial spinning radar to use triangular frequency modulation. In this paper, we develop a novel way to use this modulation to extract radial Doppler velocity measurements from consecutive azimuths of a radar intensity scan, without any data association. We show that these noisy, error-prone measurements contain enough information to provide good ego-velocity estimates, and incorporate these estimates into different modern odometry pipelines.

In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control.

The prototype's performance is assessed in real experiments demonstrating the decoupling between the forces and moments of the drone, its ability to track concurrently independent positions and orientations, and its ability to hover at a fixed position while rotating.",,,,,,

However, most existing passive-wheeled bimodal vehicles rely on attitude regulation to generate forward thrust, which inevitably results in energy waste on producing lifting force. In this work, we propose a novel passive-wheeled bimodal vehicle called TrofyBot that can rapidly change the thrust direction with a single servo motor and a transformable parallelogram linkage mechanism (TPLM). Cooperating with a bidirectional force generation module (BFGM) for motors to produce bidirectional thrust, the robot achieves flexible mobility as a differential driven rover on the ground. This design achieves 95.37% energy saving efficiency in terrestrial locomotion, allowing the robot continuously move on the ground for more than two hours in current setup. Furthermore, the design obviates the need for attitude regulation and therefore provides a stable sensor field of view (FoV). We model the bimodal dynamics for the system, analyze its differential flatness property, and design a controller based on hybrid model predictive control for trajectory tracking. A prototype is built and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the design and the proposed controller, which achieves high energy efficiency and seamless transition between modes.",,,,,,

Our approach relies on receding-horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable inter-agent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach.

Aerial Robots: Mechanics and Control 2,HPA-MPC: Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors with Suspended Loads,"Sarvaiya, Mrunal;Li, Guanrui;Loianno, Giuseppe","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Aerial Systems: Perception and Autonomy","Abstract: Quadrotors equipped with cable-suspended loads represent a versatile, low-cost, and energy efficient solution for aerial transportation, construction, and manipulation tasks. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by several challenges. The system is difficult to control because it is nonlinear, underactuated, involves hybrid dynamics due to slack-taut cable modes, and evolves on complex configuration spaces. Additionally, it is crucial to estimate the full state and the cableÂ’s mode transitions in real-time using on-board sensors and computation. To address these challenges, we present a novel Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HPA-MPC) control approach for quadrotors with suspended loads. Our method considers the complete hybrid system dynamics and includes a perception-aware cost to ensure the payload remains visible in the robotÂ’s camera during navigation. Furthermore, the full state and hybrid dynamicsÂ’ transitions are estimated using onboard sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables stable load tracking control, even during slack-taut transitions, and operates entirely onboard. The experiments also show that the perception-aware term effectively keeps the payload in the robotÂ’s camera field of view when a human operator interacts with the load.",,,,,,
Perception for Grasping and Manipulation,Unifying Representation and Calibration with 3D Foundation Models,"Zhi, Weiming;Tang, Haozhan;Zhang, Tianyi;Johnson-Roberson, Matthew","Keywords: Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Representing the environment is a central challenge in robotics, and is essential for effective decision-making. Traditionally, before capturing images with a manipulator-mounted camera, users need to calibrate the camera using a specific external marker, such as a checkerboard or AprilTag. However, recent advances in computer vision have led to the development of 3D foundation models. These are large, pre-trained neural networks that can establish fast and accurate multi-view correspondences with very few images, even in the absence of rich visual features. This paper advocates for the integration of 3D foundation models into scene representation approaches for robotic systems equipped with manipulator-mounted RGB cameras. Specifically, we propose the Joint Calibration and Representation (JCR) method. JCR uses RGB images, captured by a manipulator-mounted camera, to simultaneously construct an environmental representation and calibrate the camera relative to the robot's end-effector, in the absence of specific calibration markers. The resulting 3D environment representation is aligned with the robot's coordinate frame and maintains physically accurate scales. We demonstrate that JCR can build effective scene representations using a low-cost RGB camera attached to a manipulator, without prior calibration.",,,,,,

A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is poten- tially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA Â– which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training Â– to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks.

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage.

Compared with the ring-shaped piezoelectric acoustic receivers in previous PDMÂ² sensors, the acoustic signal received by the new fiber-tip SMOUT is readout optically, which is naturally resistant to surrounding electromagnetic interference (EMI) and making the complex grounding and shielding unnecessary. In addition, the new fiber-tip SMOUT receiver has a much smaller size, which makes it possible to further miniaturize the sensor package into a more compact structure. For verification, a prototype of the full-optical PDMÂ² sensor has been designed, fabricated, and characterized. The experimental results show that even with the much smaller acoustic receiver, the new sensor can still achieve comparable ranging and material/structure sensing performances with the previous ones.

NC is a novel bio-inspired paradigm for energy efficient neural computation, often relying on SNNs in which neurons communicate via spikes in a sparse, event-based manner. This communication via spikes can be exploited by neuromorphic hardware implementations very effectively and results in drastic reductions of energy consumption and latency in contrast to regular GPU-based neural networks. In recent years, neuromorphic hardware has become more accessible and the support of learning frameworks has improved. However, available hardware is partially still experimental, and it is not transparent what these solutions are effectively capable of, how they integrate into real world robotics applications, and how they realistically benefit energy efficiency and latency.

We develop a method that leverages foundation models to refine predictions from existing driving perception models---such as enhancing object classification accuracy---while minimizing the frequency of using these resource-intensive models. The method quantitatively characterizes uncertainties in the perception model's predictions and engages the foundation model only when these uncertainties exceed a pre-specified threshold. Specifically, it characterizes uncertainty by calibrating the perception modelÂ’s confidence scores into theoretical lower bounds on the probability of correct predictions using conformal prediction. Then, it sends images to the foundation model and queries for refining the predictions only if the theoretical bound of the perception model's outcome is below the threshold. Additionally, we propose a temporal inference mechanism that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating historical predictions, leading to tighter theoretical bounds.

Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, real-world image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module.

Firstly, existing SSL-based methods generate sparse annotations lacking detailed boundary information. Secondly, their strategies focus on hard samples for rapid adaptation, leading to forgetting and biased predictions. In this work, we propose IMOST, a continual traversability learning framework composed of two key modules: incremental dynamic memory (IDM) and self-supervised annotation (SSA).

In contrast, end-to-end paradigms unify multi-tasks into a fully differentiable framework, allowing for optimization in a planning-oriented spirit. Despite the great potential of end-to-end paradigms, both the performance and efficiency of existing methods are not satisfactory, particularly in terms of planning safety. We attribute this to the computationally expensive BEV (bird's eye view) features and the straightforward design for prediction and planning. To this end, we explore the sparse representation and review the task design for end-to-end autonomous driving, proposing a new paradigm named SparseDrive. Concretely, SparseDrive consists of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner. The sparse perception module unifies detection, tracking and online mapping with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse representation of the driving scene. For motion prediction and planning, we review the great similarity between these two tasks, leading to a parallel design for motion planner.

Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for both human hands and robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-Ï€) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-Ï€ completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis.

The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose Discrete Policy, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15% higher than OpenVLA.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework that can jointly train a dynamics model and a factor graph estimator. Our approach leverages a Gram-Schmidt (GS) process to extract roto-translational invariant representations to improve the model performance, which can further reduce the validation error compared to data augmentation method.

These approaches rely on large in-domain pre-training datasets or require substantial human labelling effort. We propose a planning method for semi-supervised active learning of semantic segmentation that substantially reduces human labelling requirements compared to fully supervised approaches. We leverage an adaptive map-based planner guided towards the frontiers of unexplored space with high model uncertainty, collecting training data for human labelling. A key aspect of our approach is to combine the sparse high-quality human labels with pseudo labels automatically extracted from highly certain environment map areas. Experimental results show that our method reaches segmentation performance close to fully supervised approaches with drastically reduced human labelling effort while outperforming self-supervised approaches.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 5,FutureNet-LOF: Joint Trajectory Prediction and Lane Occupancy Field Prediction with Future Context Encoding,"Wang, Mingkun;Ren, Xiaoguang;Jin, Ruochun;Li, Minglong;Zhang, Xiaochuan;Yu, Changqian;Wang, Mingxu;Yang, Wenjing","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Computer Vision for Transportation, Computer Vision for Automation","Abstract: Most prior motion prediction endeavors in autonomous driving have inadequately encoded future scenarios, leading to predictions that may fail to accurately capture the diverse movements of agents (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network for joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2, while it is also the champion method of the CVPR 2024 Argoverse 2 motion forecasting challenge.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 5,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Safe Mapless Navigation with Congestion Estimation,"Gao, Jianqi;Pang, Xizheng;Liu, Qi;Li, Yanjie","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Collision Avoidance, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based mapless navigation holds significant potential. However, it faces challenges in indoor environments with local minima area. This paper introduces a safe mapless navigation framework utilizing hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to enhance navigation through such areas. The high-level policy creates a sub-goal to direct the navigation process. Notably, we have developed a sub-goal update mechanism that considers environment congestion, efficiently avoiding the entrapment of the robot in local minimum areas. The low-level motion planning policy, trained through safe reinforcement learning, outputs real-time control instructions based on acquired sub-goal. Specifically, to enhance the robot's environmental perception, we introduce a new obstacle encoding method that evaluates the impact of obstacles on the robot's motion planning. To validate the performance of our HRL-based navigation framework, we conduct simulations in office, home, and restaurant environments. The findings demonstrate that our HRL-based navigation framework excels in both static and dynamic scenarios. Finally, we implement the HRL-based navigation framework on a TurtleBot3 robot for physical validation experiments, which exhibits its strong generalization capabilities.",,,,,,
Motion Planning 5,Hierarchical End-To-End Autonomous Driving: Integrating BEV Perception with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Lu, Siyi;He, Lei;Li, Shengbo Eben;Luo, Yugong;Wang, Jianqiang;Li, Keqiang","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Control, Reinforcement Learning, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving offers a streamlined alternative to the traditional modular pipeline, integrating perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently gained traction in this domain, existing approaches often overlook the critical connection between feature extraction of DRL and perception. In this paper, we bridge this gap by mapping the DRL feature extraction network directly to the perception phase, enabling clearer interpretation through semantic segmentation. By leveraging BirdÂ’s-Eye-View (BEV) representations, we propose a novel DRL-based end-to-end driving framework that utilizes multi-sensor inputs to construct a unified three-dimensional understanding of the environment. This BEV-based system extracts and translates critical environmental features into high-level abstract states for DRL, facilitating more informed control. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach not only enhances interpretability but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in autonomous driving control tasks, reducing the collision rate by 20%.

Motion Planning 5,Multi-Goal Motion Memory,"Lu, Yuanjie;Das, Dibyendu;Plaku, Erion;Xiao, Xuesu","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Motion and Path Planning, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots (e.g., warehouse logistics robots) often need to traverse complex, obstacle-rich, and changing environments to reach multiple fixed goals (e.g., warehouse shelves). Traditional motion planners need to calculate the entire multi-goal path from scratch in response to changes in the environment, which results in a large consumption of computing resources. This process is not only time-consuming but also may not meet real-time requirements in application scenarios that require rapid response to environmental changes. In this paper, we provide a novel Multi-Goal Motion Memory technique that allows robots to use previous planning experiences to accelerate future multi-goal planning in changing environments. Specifically, our technique predicts collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories and distances between goal pairs to guide the sampling process to build a roadmap, to inform a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver to compute a tour, and to efficiently produce motion plans. Experiments conducted with a vehicle and a snake-like robot in obstacle-rich environments show that the proposed Motion Memory technique can substantially accelerate planning speed by up to 90%. Furthermore, the solution quality is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms and even better in some environments.",,,,,,

The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing BirdÂ’s Eye View (BEV) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected into the global traversability probability map generated by the global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal path. By integrating the traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer BEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to 18.26%. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local BEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall plan",,,,,,

However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a chance-constrained hybrid partially observable Markov decision process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex mixed integer linear program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and > 50% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.",,,,,,

This approach allows for dynamic adjustment of the formation orientation and introduces a collaborative obstacle avoidance strategy. This strategy is specifically designed to assess and integrate the influence of obstacles into the optimization process, thereby enhancing the ability to maneuver around obstacles. Simulation experiments, including scenarios involving the encirclement of stationary and moving targets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In our previous work we have provided a detailed definition of this problem, specifying the objectives and the constraints involved, a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for it, a formal analysis of its worst-case computational complexity, and additional structural properties of the optimal solutions that enable a partial relaxation of the original MIP formulation which preserves optimal performance. We have further employed these structural results towards the development of a construction heuristic for this problem. But while the worst-case computational complexity of the construction heuristic is polynomial with respect to the size of the problem-defining elements, its practical scalability has been limited by the requirement to formulate and solve a large number of linear programming formulations. In order to address this issue, this work presents a modified version of the heuristic that significantly reduces the computational times involved.

In this paper, we consider using drone swarms as video game platforms and utilize planning techniques to display pixels in animations correctly while providing a fast response to user inputs. We devise a new sampling algorithm to solve a contingency formation planning problem, which aims to find a contingency formation plan such that drones can always move to the correct positions to display every possible future frame regardless of the user inputs in the future. The algorithm provides interactivity by preemptively relocating hidden drones, which move in stealth mode to the locations of all possible future frames.

This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.",,,,,,

However, it is not trivial to optimally assign tasks among agents because the state dynamically changes while the local observations of multiple agents concurrently update the global map. Furthermore, the individual robots may not have access to accurate relative poses of others or global layouts. We propose an efficient spatial abstraction for multi-agent exploration based on topological graph memories. Each agent creates a topological graph, a lightweight spatial representation whose nodes contain minimal image features. The information in graphs is aggregated to compare individual nodes and is used to update the similarity scores in real-time. Then, the agents effectively fulfill distributed task goals by examining the dynamic similarity scores of frontier nodes. We further exploit extracted visual features to refine the relative poses among topological graphs. Our proposed pipeline can efficiently explore large-scale areas among various scene and robot configurations without sharing precise geometric information.",,,,,,

In this paper, we introduce RobotPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time.

Recent advances in perception algorithms, combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) for planning, offer promising solutions to these challenges, as the common sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs provide a strong heuristic for efficiently searching the action space. However, prior work fails to address the possibility of hallucinations from LLMs, which results in failures to execute the planned actions largely due to logical fallacies at high- or low-levels. To contend with automation failure due to such hallucinations, we introduce ConceptAgent, a natural language-driven robotic platform designed for task execution in unstructured environments. With a focus on scalability and reliability of LLM-based planning in complex state and action spaces, we present innovations designed to limit these shortcomings, including 1) Predicate Grounding to prevent and recover from infeasible actions, and 2) an embodied version of LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search with self reflection. ConceptAgent combines these planning enhancements with dynamic language aligned 3d scene graphs, and large multi-modal pretrained models to perceive, localize, and interact with its environment, enabling reliable task completion.

The surge in Artificial Intelligence-driven visual robotic inspection methods necessitates high-quality datasets containing diverse defect classes with several instances on different conditions (e.g., material, illumination). In this context, we introduce a Controllable Object Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network (COIGAN) to synthetically generate realistic images that augment defect datasets. The effectiveness of the model is quantitatively validated by a FrÃ©chet Inception Distance, which measures the similarity between the generated and training samples. To further evaluate the impact of COIGAN-generated images, a segmentation task was conducted, utilizing key performance metrics such as segmentation accuracy, mAP, mIoU, and F1 score, demonstrating that the synthetic images integrate seamlessly and produce results comparable to real defect images. Subsequently, COIGAN generability was successfully used for the segmentation of a defect-free dataset by inpainting defects. The results showcase COIGAN's ability to learn defect patterns and apply them in new contexts, preserving the original features of the base image and allowing the creation of new datasets with a desired multi-class distribution.

Robotic systems with long kinematic chains are required to reach complex workspaces, including floors, walls, and ceilings. These requirements significantly impact positioning accuracy due to effects such as deflection and backlash in various parts along the kinematic chain. In this letter, we introduce a novel approach that integrates deflection and backlash compensation models with high-accuracy accelerometers, significantly enhancing position accuracy. Our method employs a modular framework based on a factor graph formulation to estimate the state of the kinematic chain, leveraging acceleration measurements to inform the model. Extensive testing on publicly released datasets, reflecting real-world construction disturbances, demonstrates the advantages of our approach. The proposed method reduces the 95% error threshold in the xy-plane by 50% compared to the state-of-the-art Virtual Joint Method, and by 31% when incorporating base tilt compensation.",,,,,,
Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,Open-Loop Position Control of a Miniature Magnetic Robot Using Two-Dimensional Divergence Control of a Magnetic Force,"Lee, Hakjoon;Latifi Gharamaleki, Nader;Choi, Hongsoo","Keywords: Micro/Nano Robots, Automation at Micro-Nano Scales, Actuation and Joint Mechanisms","Abstract: Miniature magnetic robots have attracted considerable attention as promising tools in biomedical applications due to their wireless actuation and precise controllability in a minimally invasive manner. Traditionally, magnetic microrobots have been controlled by globally applied magnetic torques and forces generated by external magnetic actuation systems (MASs), which typically require closed-loop control with real-time vision trackingÂ—a challenging requirement in in-vivo environments. To address this issue, this paper suggests a novel open-loop control scheme for magnetic robots, using two-dimensional (2D) divergence control of a magnetic force generated by stationary electromagnets. Constraint equations for the currents applied to the electromagnets were established to achieve 2D divergence control of a magnetic force. Numerical simulation and experimental validations demonstrate that this approach can generate sufficient magnetic forces that either converge at or diverge from a target point, enabling effective open-loop position control of a miniature magnetic robot. Due to the absence of vision feedback and mechanical motions of magnets, the proposed control strategy could be more clinically applicable for medical applications of magnetic robots.",,,,,,
Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,An Equilibrium Analysis of Magnetic Quadrupole Force Field with Applications to Microrobotic Swarm Coordination,"Faros, Ioannis;Tanner, Herbert G.","Keywords: Swarm Robotics, Planning, Scheduling and Coordination, Micro/Nano Robots","Abstract: Controlled microrobots in fluidic environments hold promise for precise drug delivery and cell manipulation, opening new ways for personalized healthcare. However, coordinating magnetic microrobot swarms presents significant challenges due to the complexity of the associated actuation mechanisms. While existing methods to achieve motion differentiation in collections of microrobots rely on design variations among them, the work reported here applies to homogeneous collectives and enables them to be steered as a whole or in fragments, by means of a common externally generated force field. This paper contributes to an emerging set of methods that enable swarm control through manipulation of these force fields. This paper in particular exploits the nature of force field equilibria in a quadrupole workspace configuration as a means of steering the swarm while maintaining its cohesion. The approach also enables splitting the swarm in two subgroups in order to direct each simultaneously to a different location.",,,,,,
Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,Ensemble Control of a 2-DOF Parallel Link Arm in a Capsule Robot Using Oscillating External Magnetic Fields,"Zhao, Zihan;Hafez, Ahmed;Miyashita, Shuhei","Keywords: Medical Robots and Systems, Mechanism Design, Micro/Nano Robots","Abstract: Providing oral capsule robots with additional degrees of freedom (DOF), such as robotic arms, is crucial for enhancing their functionality within the body. However, a key challenge arises when using rotating magnetic fields to drive the motor within the robot, as the resulting torque causes the entire capsule to rotate. In this work, we propose a novel approach to actuate a 2 DOF parallel link robot arm integrated into a capsule robot, using external magnetic fields. Our method employs two identical magnetic motors we proposed in a previous study, each driven by an oscillating magnetic field, which alternates direction along a specific axis. By independently controlling the rotation of each motor through the same magnetic field, ensemble control is achieved. The symmetrically arranged motors exhibit different angular velocities, enabling dexterous movement of the robot arm. We further theoretically show that this approach significantly reduces the torque exerted on the robot compared to traditional rotating magnetic fields. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the robot by moving its arms and the attached end-effector along a pre-defined trajectory.",,,,,,
Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-Robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation,"Mao, Yudong;Zhang, Dandan","Keywords: Micro/Nano Robots, Automation at Micro-Nano Scales","Abstract: Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.",,,,,,

However, clinical adoption of these robots is rare as these systems are often difficult to scale up. One such issue arises from the actuation systems used to remotely control magnetic microrobots, which tend to be bulky and obstruct the surgeons' workspaces. They also do not guarantee wide ranges of magnetic fields and forces in a large patient-sized workspace. In this paper, we present the design of a permanent magnet-based actuation system that fits within a 40 cm cube of space under an operating table. We also formulate a new set function maximization-based approach for efficiently designing E-optimal magnet arrangements with off-the-shelf convex solvers.

Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,Measuring DNA Microswimmer Locomotion in Complex Flow Environments,"Imamura, Taryn;Kent, Teresa;Taylor, Rebecca;Bergbreiter, Sarah","Keywords: Micro/Nano Robots, Biologically-Inspired Robots, Automation at Micro-Nano Scales","Abstract: Microswimmers are sub-millimeter swimming robots that show potential as a platform for controllable locomotion in applications, including targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive surgery. To be viable for these target applications, microswimmers will eventually need to be able to navigate environments with dynamic fluid flows and forces. Experimental studies with microswimmers towards this goal are currently rare because of the difficulty of isolating intentional microswimmer locomotion from environment-induced motion. In this work, we present a method for measuring microswimmer locomotion within a complex flow environment using fiducial microspheres. By tracking the particle motion of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic polystyrene fiducial microspheres, we capture the effect of fluid flow and magnetic field gradients on microswimmer trajectories. We then determine the field-driven translation of these microswimmers relative to fluid flow and demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by illustrating the motion of multiple microswimmers through different flows.",,,,,,
Manipulation and Locomotion Using Magnetic Fields,Position Regulation of a Conductive Nonmagnetic Object with Two Stationary Field Sources,"Dalton, Devin;Tabor, Griffin;Hermans, Tucker;Abbott, Jake J.","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Force Control, Manipulation Planning, Space Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Recent research has shown that eddy currents induced by rotating magnetic dipole fields in conductive nonmagnetic objects can produce forces and torques that enable dexterous manipulation. This paradigm shows promise for application in the remediation of space debris. The induced force from each rotating-magnetic-dipole field source always includes a repulsive component, suggesting that the object should be surrounded by field sources to some degree to ensure the object does not leave the dexterous workspace during manipulation. In this paper, we show that it is possible to fully control the position of an object using just two stationary field sources, provided the object is near the midpoint between the field sources. A given position controller requires a low-level force controller. We propose two new force controllers and compare them with the state-of-the-art method from the literature. One of the new force controllers is particularly good at not inducing parasitic torques, which is hypothesized to be beneficial for future tasks manipulating rotating resident space objects.

Furthermore, they need to adapt to new social scenarios that can arise during robot navigation. In this paper, we present a novel Online Lifelong Vision Language architecture, OLiVia-Nav, which uniquely integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with an online lifelong learning framework for robot social navigation. We introduce a unique distillation approach, Social Context Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (SC-CLIP), to transfer the social reasoning capabilities of large VLMs to a lightweight VLM, in order for OLiVia-Nav to directly encode social and environment context during robot navigation. These encoded embeddings are used to generate and select robot social compliant trajectories. The lifelong learning capabilities of SC-CLIP enable OLiVia-Nav to update the robot trajectory planning overtime as new social scenarios are encountered. We conducted extensive real-world experiments in diverse social navigation scenarios.

Social Navigation 1,Active Inference-Based Planning for Safe Human-Robot Interaction: Concurrent Consideration of Human Characteristic and Rationality,"Nam, Youngim;Kwon, Cheolhyeon","Keywords: Human-Aware Motion Planning, Safety in HRI, Planning under Uncertainty","Abstract: This paper proposes a motion planning strategy for a robot to safely interact with humans exhibiting uncertain actions. The human actions are often encoded by the internal states that are attributed to human characteristics and rationality. First, by leveraging a continuous level of rationality, we compute the belief on human rationality along with his/her characteristic. This systematically reasons out the uncertainty in the observed human action, thereby better assessing the potential safety risks during the interaction. Second, based on the computed belief over the human internal states, we formulate a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) problem to plan the robotÂ’s actions such that it safely achieves its goal while also actively inferring on the human internal state. To cope with the expensive computation of the SMPC, we develop a sampling-based technique that efficiently evaluates the robotÂ’s action conditioned on human uncertainty. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy excels in human action prediction, and significantly improves the safety and efficiency of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).",,,,,,

Our key insight is that an understanding of the inherent complexity of a social robot navigation scenario could help characterize the limitations of existing navigation algorithms and provide actionable directions for improvement. Through an exploration of recent literature, we identify a series of factors contributing to the complexity of a scenario, disambiguating between contextual and robot-related ones. We then conduct a simulation study investigating how manipulations of contextual factors impact the performance of a variety of navigation algorithms. We find that dense and narrow environments correlate most strongly with performance drops, while the heterogeneity of agent policies and directionality of interactions have a less pronounced effect. This motivates a shift towards developing and testing algorithms under higher-complexity settings.",,,,,,
Social Navigation 1,Domain Randomization for Learning to Navigate in Human Environments (Resubmission),"Ah Sen, Nick;Kulic, Dana;Carreno, Pamela","Keywords: Human-Aware Motion Planning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: In shared human-robot environments, effective navigation requires robots to adapt to various pedestrian behaviors encountered in the real world. Most existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for human-aware robot navigation typically assume that pedestrians adhere to a single walking behavior during training, limiting their practicality/performance in scenarios where pedestrians exhibit various types of behavior. In this work, we propose to enhance the generalization capabilities of human-aware robot navigation by employing Domain Randomization (DR) techniques to train navigation policies on a diverse range of simulated pedestrian behaviors with the hope of better generalization to the real world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the generalization capabilities of a robot navigation policy trained with and without DR, both in simulations and through a real-user study, focusing on adaptability to different pedestrian behaviors, performance in novel environments, and users' perceived comfort, sociability and naturalness. Our findings reveal that the use of DR significantly enhances the robot's social compliance in both simulated and real-life contexts.",,,,,,

Evaluating robustness in general dexterous manipulation, nonetheless, poses significant challenges due to complex hybrid dynamics, combinatorial explosion of possible contact interactions, global geometry, etc. This paper introduces ``caging in motion'', an approach for analyzing manipulation robustness through energy margins and caging-based analysis. Our method assesses manipulation robustness by measuring the energy margin to failure and extends traditional caging concepts for a global analysis of dynamic manipulation. This global analysis is facilitated by a kinodynamic planning framework that naturally integrates global geometry, contact changes, and robot compliance.

The task poses significant challenges for motion planning due to the high-dimensional output actions with the complex input information, including unknown object properties and nonlinear contact forces. Traditional approaches simplify the problem by reducing degrees of freedom, limiting contact forms, or acquiring environment/object information in advanceÂ—significantly compromising adaptability. To address these challenges, we deconstruct the complex output actions into three fundamental types based on tactile sensing: task-oriented actions, constraint-oriented actions, and coordinating actions. These actions are then optimized online using gradient optimization to enhance adaptability. Key contributions include simplifying contact state perception, decomposing complex gripper actions, and enabling online action optimization for handling unknown objects or environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of everyday objects, regardless of environmental contact. Additionally, the method exhibits robust performance even in the presence of unknown contacts and nonlinear external disturbances.",,,,,,

We propose an online learning and optimization method to identify and avoid unobserved obstacles online. Our method, Constraint Obeying Gaussian Implicit Surfaces (COGIS), infers contact data using a combination of visual input and state tracking, informed by predictions from a nominal dynamics model. We then fit a Gaussian process implicit surface (GPIS) to these data and refine the dataset through a novel method of enforcing constraints on the estimated surface. This allows us to design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that leverages the obstacle estimate to complete multiple manipulation tasks. By modeling the environment instead of attempting to directly adapt the dynamics, our method succeeds at both low-dimensional peg-in-hole tasks and high-dimensional deformable object manipulation tasks.

While differentiable simulators have recently emerged for multi-body robotic systems, they remain underutilized, despite their potential to provide richer information. This underutilization, coupled with the high computational cost of exploration-exploitation in high-dimensional state spaces, limits the practical application of RL in the real-world. We propose a method that integrates learning with differentiable simulators to enhance the efficiency of exploration-exploitation. Our approach learns value functions, state trajectories, and control policies from locally optimal runs of a model-based trajectory optimizer. The learned value function acts as a proxy to shorten the preview horizon, while approximated state and control policies guide the trajectory optimization.

We propose TransformerMPC, a method that enhances the computational efficiency of MPC algorithms by leveraging the attention mechanism in transformers for both online constraint removal and better warm start initialization. Specifically, TransformerMPC accelerates the computation of optimal control inputs by selecting only the active constraints to be included in the MPC problem, while simultaneously providing a warm start to the optimization process. This approach ensures that the original constraints are satisfied at optimality. TransformerMPC is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any solver, irrespective of its implementation. To guarantee constraint satisfaction after removing inactive constraints, we perform an offline verification to ensure that the optimal control inputs generated by the solver meet all constraints. The effectiveness of TransformerMPC is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations on complex robotic systems, achieving up to 35x improvement in runtime without any loss in performance.",,,,,,

These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.",,,,,,

We assume that the robot detects and models nearby obstacle boundaries with a short-range sensor and that this detection is error-free. This problem presents three main challenges: i) input constraints, ii) safety, and iii) real-time computation. To tackle all three challenges, we present a layered control architecture (LCA) consisting of an offline path library generation layer, and an online path selection and safety layer. To overcome the limitations of reactive methods, our offline path library consists of feasible controllers, feedback gains, and reference trajectories. To handle computational burden and safety, we solve online path selection and generate safe inputs that run at 100 Hz.

However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.

"Soft Robotics: Modeling, Control, and Learning",Robust Swimming Controller for Soft Robots Via Drop-Out Learning,"Monica, Josephine;Campbell, Mark","Keywords: Soft Robot Applications, Reinforcement Learning, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: A novel framework for training a robotic fish to learn how to swim, even in the presence of degradations or failures in actuators is developed. Robotic underwater robots, particularly soft fish-inspired designs have gained significant attention due to their distinct benefits, including superior maneuverability, energy efficiency, versatile applications, and seamless integration with marine environments. However, their material properties and actuators can degrade, leading to pre-mature system failures. In this paper, we introduce the concept of actuator drop-out during training, to enable the robot to learn how to swim even when one or more actuators are degraded or non-functional. A Soft Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture is used to learn a policy, with actuator degradations/failures introduced during training. A four actuator koi fish is modeled and simulated using the FishGym environment. Navigation-based validation tests show little degradation with one actuator failure, and much more robust swimming behaviors and performance compared to training with no failures, even when two or three actuators fail. These results will improve long-term operational reliability, ensuring robot fish functionality even in challenging underwater conditions.",,,,,,
"Soft Robotics: Modeling, Control, and Learning",Optimal Gait Control for a Tendon-Driven Soft Quadruped Robot by Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,"Niu, Xuezhi;Tan, Kaige;Gurdur Broo, Didem;Feng, Lei","Keywords: Modeling, Control, and Learning for Soft Robots, Soft Sensors and Actuators, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to optimal gait control for a soft quadruped robot enabled by four compressible tendon-driven soft actuators. Soft quadruped robots, compared to their rigid counterparts, are widely recognized for offering enhanced safety, lower weight, and simpler fabrication and control mechanisms. However, their highly deformable structure introduces nonlinear dynamics, making precise gait locomotion control complex. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method. The study employs a multi-stage approach, including state space restriction, data-driven surrogate model training, and MBRL development. Compared to benchmark methods, the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency and performance of gait control policies. The developed policy is both robust and adaptable to the robot's deformable morphology. The study concludes by highlighting the practical applicability of these findings in real-world scenarios.",,,,,,

Modeling the complex, nonlinear behaviors and controlling the deformable structures of soft robots present challenges. This study aims to establish a physics-guided deep learning (PGDL) computational framework that integrates physical models into deep learning framework as surrogate models for soft robots. Once trained, these models can replace computationally expensive numerical simulations to shorten the computation time and enable real-time control. This PGDL framework is among the first to integrate first principle physics of soft robots into deep learning toward highly accurate yet computationally affordable models for soft robot modeling and control. The proposed framework has been implemented and validated using three different pneumatic soft fingers with different behaviors and geometries, along with two training and testing approaches, to demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. The results showed that the mean square error (MSE) of predicted deformed curvature and the maximum and minimum deformation at various loading conditions were as low as 10âˆ? mm2. The proposed PGDL framework is constructed from first principle physics and intrinsically can be applicable to various conditions by carefully considering the governing equations, auxiliary equations, and the corresponding boundary and initial conditions.",,,,,,

G.;Seel, Thomas;Schappler, Moritz","Keywords: Modeling, Control, and Learning for Soft Robots, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: Soft robots pose difficulties in terms of control, requiring novel strategies to effectively manipulate their compliant structures. Model-based approaches face challenges due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearities such as hysteresis effects. In contrast, learning-based approaches provide nonlinear models of different soft robots based only on measured data. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) predict the behavior of an articulated soft robot (ASR) with five degrees of freedom (DoF). RNNs based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) are compared to the more commonly used long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and show better accuracy. The recurrence enables to capture hysteresis effects that are inherent in soft robots due to viscoelasticity or friction but cannot be captured by simple feedforward networks. The data-driven model is used within a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), whereby the correct handling of the RNN's hidden states is focused. A training approach is presented that allows measured values to be utilized in each control cycle. This enables accurate predictions of short horizons based on sensor data, which is crucial for closed-loop NMPC. The proposed learning-based NMPC enables trajectory tracking with an average error of 1.2 deg in experiments with the pneumatic five-DoF ASR.",,,,,,

A steerable stylet can be used to guide the needle within the tissue, improving procedure accuracy and reducing the number of needles required for each operation. This work introduces the design of a novel tendon-assisted magnetically steered (TAMS) robotic stylet to steer commercially available brachytherapy needles. The dual-actuation modality (magnetic and tendon-driven) allows for increased bending compliance while retaining axial rigidity at extremely small diameters (OD: 1.4 mm), key properties for steering hollow needles from within their lumen. We also develop a two-tube Cosserat rod model that estimates the behavior of the TAMS robot and needle assembly under actuation from tendons, external magnetic fields, and finally combined magnet+tendon forces. We validate our model in free space and demonstrate the capability of the TAMS robot and dual-actuation modalities to steer brachytherapy needles to high curvatures inside phantom tissue.",,,,,,

However, advancing surgeon-robot collaboration still requires further research, particularly on task-specific automation. For instance, automated tool segmentation can assist surgeons in visualizing and tracking endovascular tools during procedures. While learning-based models have demonstrated state-of-the- art segmentation performances, generating ground-truth labels for fully-supervised methods is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly. In this study, we developed a weakly-supervised learning method that is based on multi-lateral pseudo labeling for tool segmentation in cardiovascular angiogram datasets. The method utilizes a modified U-Net architecture featuring one encoder and multiple laterally branched decoders. The decoders generate diverse pseudo labels under different perturbations to augment the available partial annotation for model training. A mixed loss function with shared consistency was adapted for this purpose. The weakly-supervised model was trained end-to-end and validated using partially annotated angiogram data from three cardiovascular catheterization procedures. Validation results show that the weakly-supervised model could perform closer to fully-supervised models. Furthermore, the proposed multi-lateral approach outperforms three well known weakly- supervised learning methods, offering the highest segmentation performance across the three angiogram datasets. Numerous ablation studies confirmed the modelÂ’s consistent performance under different settings. Finally, the model was applied for tool segmentation in a robot-assisted catheterization experiments. The model enhanced visualization with high connectivity indices for guidewire and catheter, and a mean segmentation time of 35.26ms per frame.

Incomplete state feedback of the guidewire from 2D perspective images and unknown interactions with the surrounding vessel wall raise challenges in modeling and steering control. These two factors, however, are commonly overlooked by existing works. In this paper, 2D perspective images of the guidewire, which comply with prevalent medical imaging modalities, are used as the only feedback. A model-based external force observer is proposed that allows the guidewire to perceive the unknown interactions, and a compliance controller is subsequently designed to handle the external force while steering the guidewire. Experiments conducted in a human-sized phantom demonstrate how the compliance controller preserves stability and safety by adapting to the estimated external force.",,,,,,

However, OT has many unavoidable drawbacks, including strict performing scenarios, significant scarring, and the risk of surgeon infection. Percutaneous dilation tracheostomy (PDT) emerges, with advantages including a lower cost, smaller scarring, and better protection of surgeons from inflecting by aerosol. However, the outside-in puncture manner of PDT has a risk of piercing the post-tracheal wall and the esophagus with uncontrolled force. Additionally, locating tracheal rings and determining the puncture site externally can be challenging for certain patients, such as those who are obese or have undergone neck surgery, while this procedure typically relies on palpation and the surgeon's expertise. Hence, to improve the safety and simplicity of tracheostomy, a minimally-invasive endotracheal inside-out flexible needle-driving system towards microendoscope-guided robotic tracheostomy (MERT) has been proposed in this paper. Guided by an optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe and a microendoscope, the robot inserts into the trachea and performs an inside-out puncture using a flexible needle. The robot can work through a standard endotracheal tube (ETT), and the puncture direction of the flexible needle is variable. Kinematics and statics models of the flexible needle have been derived, and the minimum position errors generated in the kinematics and statics validation experiments are 0.57 pm 0.21 mm and 0.27 pm 0.21 mm.

Novel Methods for Mapping and Localization,Fieldscale: Locality-Aware Field-Based Adaptive Rescaling for Thermal Infrared Image,"Gil, Hyeonjae;Jeon, Myung-Hwan;Kim, Ayoung","Keywords: Computer Vision for Transportation, Recognition, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras are emerging as promising sensors in safety-related fields due to their robustness against external illumination. However, RAW TIR image has 14 bits of pixel depth and needs to be rescaled into 8 bits for general applications. Previous works utilize a global 1D look-up table to compute pixel-wise gain solely based on its intensity, which degrades image quality by failing to consider the local nature of the heat. We propose Fieldscale, a rescaling based on locality-aware 2D fields where both the intensity value and spatial context of each pixel within an image are embedded. It can adaptively determine the pixel gain for each region and produce spatially consistent 8-bit rescaled images with minimal information loss and high visibility. Consistent performance improvement on image quality assessment and two other downstream tasks support the effectiveness and usability of Fieldscale.

Despite the advantages, aerial data also comes with challenges such as a sensor-modality gap and a viewpoint difference gap. Learned localization methods have shown promise for overcoming these challenges to provide precise metric localization for autonomous vehicles. Most learned localization methods rely on coarsely aligned ground truth, or implicit consistency-based methods to learn the localization task Â– however, in this paper we find that improving the alignment between aerial data and autonomous vehicle sensor data at training time is critical to the performance of a learning-based localization system. We compare two data alignment methods using a factor graph framework and, using these methods, we then evaluate the effects of closely aligned ground truth on learned localization accuracy through ablation studies.

Novel Methods for Mapping and Localization,Under Pressure: Altimeter-Aided ICP for 3D Maps Consistency,"Dubois, William;Samson, Nicolas;Daum, Effie;Laconte, Johann;Pomerleau, Francois","Keywords: Localization, Mapping, Field Robots","Abstract: We propose a novel method to enhance the accuracy of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm by integrating altitude constraints from a barometric pressure sensor. While ICP is widely used in mobile robotics for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), it is susceptible to drift, especially in underconstrained environments such as vertical shafts. To address this issue, we propose to augment ICP with altimeter measurements, reliably constraining drifts along the gravity vector. To demonstrate the potential of altimetry in SLAM, we offer an analysis of calibration procedures and noise sensitivity of various pressure sensors, improving measurements to centimeter-level accuracy. Leveraging this accuracy, we propose a novel ICP formulation that integrates altitude measurements along the gravity vector, thus simplifying the optimization problem to 3-Degree Of Freedom (DOF).

We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration.

Our method additionally estimates wheel slip, radii, and baseline online to improve accuracy and robustness. Further, due to the preintegration, many measurements can be summarized into a single motion constraint using first-order updates for wheel slippage and intrinsics, allowing for efficient usage in an optimization-based state estimation framework.

Maps are a key form of communication, allowing someone who has never been somewhere to nonetheless navigate that area successfully. In the context of multirobot systems, the maps and information that flow between robots are necessary for effective collaboration, whether those robots are operating concurrently, sequentially, or completely asynchronously. In this article, we argue that maps must go beyond encoding purely geometric or visual information to enable increasingly complex autonomy, particularly between robots. We propose a framework for multirobot autonomy, focusing in particular on air and ground robots operating in outdoor 2.5-D environments. We show that semantic maps can enable the specification, planning, and execution of complex collaborative missions, including localization in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied settings. A distinguishing characteristic of this work is that we strongly emphasize field experiments and testing, and by doing so demonstrate that these ideas can work at scale in the real world.

Human-Robot Interaction: Physiological Sensing,Teleoperating a 6 DoF Robotic Manipulator from Head Movements,"Poignant, Alexis;JarrassÃ©, Nathanael;Morel, Guillaume","Keywords: Telerobotics and Teleoperation, Human Detection and Tracking","Abstract: This article presents an interactive control approach allowing a human user to teleoperate a robotic manipulator located nearby. With this approach, the user keeps his/her hands free, as only head movements are exploited to control the robot. The controller maps the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) user's head position and orientation into the 6~DoF robot end-effector position and orientation.
The robot can reach a large workspace thanks to the combination of two features. Firstly, a virtual wand between the user's head and the robot end-effector converts user's head pan-tilt rotations into large displacements of the robot end-effector center perpendicularly to the wand axis (2 DoF). Secondly, for the remaining 4 DoF (robot end-effector center displacement along the wand axis and robot en-effector orientation), real-time deformation of the virtual wand is triggered when the user reaches uncomfortable configurations due to his/her head workspace limitations. Additionally, the user gets, through an Augmented Reality (AR) Headset, a non-delayed visual feedback of the current virtual wand geometry and location.
The paper includes a description of the setup and the proposed controller, detailing how the robot position/orientation is coupled to the user's head position/orientation. A set of elementary experiments with a constant-geometry wand is first presented, showing workspace limitations for some DoF. Then the wand reconfiguration is introduced in the experiments, leading to full control of 6 DoF manipulation tasks throughout a large workspace.",,,,,,

Unlike conventional surface electromyography (sEMG) sensing techniques, which require excessive pressure or adhesive electrodes, the proposed sensing method allows muscle volume variations to be detected simply by placing the device on the skin without additional pressure or adhesives. The band was evaluated in isometric-static and isometric-varying torque estimation tasks, demonstrating superior accuracy to sEMG, with a relative torque to maximum torque estimation error of less than 11.5%. In isometric-varying conditions, relative torque was estimated with an average error of 10.1% at frequencies of 0.1 Hz, 0.2 Hz, and 0.5 Hz. Furthermore, the band achieved a classification accuracy of 92.9% in recognizing ten distinct hand gestures, highlighting its capability to differentiate between multiple muscle activations.

Existing methods typically require extensive EEG data collection from each new subject, which is time-consuming and results in poor user experience. To address this issue, this paper decompose MI EEG into subject-specific private components and shared components common across all subjects, and propose a plug-and-play domain fusion adaptive method (PPMDFA) to handle variability between subjects. In the training phase, PPMDFA introduces a Multi-Domain Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (MDFGCN) module to extract shared and private features from the MI processes of source domain subjects. In the calibration phase, the method constructs private classifiers for the target new subject using the extracted shared features combined with a small amount of labeled data. During testing, PPMDFA leverages the similarity of private components to utilize knowledge from source subjects, thereby enhancing classification accuracy for target subjects' MI. We validated the proposed method on the PhysioNet and LLMBCImotion datasets.

Vision-Language-Action Models,Run-Time Observation Interventions Make Vision-Language-Action Models More Visually Robust,"Hancock, Asher;Ren, Allen Z.;Majumdar, Anirudha",Keywords: Deep Learning Methods,"Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models trained on large-scale internet data and robot demonstrations have the potential to serve as generalist robot policies. However, despite their large-scale training, VLAs are often brittle to task-irrelevant visual details such as distractor objects or background colors. We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme that (1) dynamically identifies regions of the input image that the model is sensitive to, and (2) minimally alters task-irrelevant regions to reduce the modelÂ’s sensitivity using automated image editing tools. Our approach is compatible with any off the shelf VLA without model finetuning or access to the modelÂ’s weights. Hardware experiments on language-instructed manipulation tasks demonstrate that BYOVLA enables state-of-the-art VLA models to nearly retain their nominal performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds, which otherwise degrade task success rates by up to 60%.",,,,,,

Inspired by the advances of large pre-trained models, we propose Keypoint Affordance Learning from Imagined Environments (KALIE), which adapts pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) for robotic control in a scalable manner. Instead of directly producing motor commands, KALIE controls the robot by predicting point-based affordance representations based on natural language instructions and visual observations of the scene. The VLM is trained on 2D images with affordances labeled by humans, bypassing the need for training data collected on robotic systems. Through an affordance-aware data synthesis pipeline, KALIE automatically creates massive high-quality training data based on limited example data manually collected by humans. We demonstrate that KALIE can learn to robustly solve new manipulation tasks with unseen objects given only 50 example data points. Compared to baselines using pre-trained VLMs, our approach consistently achieves superior performance.",,,,,,

These models can function as high-level planners, generating intermediate subgoals for low-level goal-conditioned policies to reach. However, the performance of these systems can be greatly bottlenecked by the interface between generative models and low-level controllers. For example, generative models may predict photo-realistic yet physically infeasible frames that confuse low-level policies. Low-level policies may also be sensitive to subtle visual artifacts in generated goal images. This paper addresses these two facets of generalization, providing an interface to effectively Â“glue togetherÂ” language-conditioned image or video prediction models with low-level goal-conditioned policies. Our method, Generative Hierarchical Imitation Learning-Glue (GHIL-Glue), filters out subgoals that do not lead to task progress and improves the robustness of goal-conditioned policies to generated subgoals with harmful visual artifacts. We find in extensive experiments in both simulated and real environments that GHIL-Glue achieves a 25% improvement across several hierarchical models that leverage generative subgoals, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the CALVIN simulation benchmark for policies using observations from a single RGB camera. GHIL-Glue also outperforms other generalist robot policies across 3/4 language-conditioned manipulation tasks testing zero-shot generalization in physical experiments.",,,,,,

However, these models are limited to reasoning over objects and actions currently visible on the image plane. We present a spatial extension to the VLM, which leverages spatially-localized egocentric video demonstrations to augment VLMs in two ways --- through understanding spatial task-affordances, i.e. where an agent must be for the task to physically take place, and the localization of that task relative to the egocentric viewer. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting representation will enable robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to, or around, physical regions of interest for novel tasks specified in natural language.",,,,,,

Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference at 50Hz in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

In many tasks, LLMs have demonstrated performance that rivals human-level common sense. However, directly applying LLMs to domain-specific use cases, such as robotic pick-and-place, remains a challenge. Tasks that are intuitive for humans, who rely on prior knowledge and skills, become complex for robots. Industrial robotic applications like pick-and-place require a high degree of accuracy, often exceeding 90%.

Deep Learning for Visual Perception 2,SCA3D: Enhancing Cross-Modal 3D Retrieval Via 3D Shape and Caption Paired Data Augmentation,"Ren, Junlong;Wu, Hao;Xiong, Hui;Wang, Hao","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Visual Learning, Recognition","Abstract: The cross-modal 3D retrieval task aims to achieve mutual matching between text descriptions and 3D shapes. This has the potential to enhance the interaction between natural language and the 3D environment, especially within the realms of robotics and embodied artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, the scarcity and expensiveness of 3D data constrain the performance of existing cross-modal 3D retrieval methods. These methods heavily rely on features derived from the limited number of 3D shapes, resulting in poor generalization ability across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce SCA3D, a novel 3D shape and caption online data augmentation method for cross-modal 3D retrieval. Our approach uses the LLaVA model to create a component library, captioning each segmented part of every 3D shape within the dataset. Notably, it facilitates the generation of extensive new 3D-text pairs containing new semantic features. We employ both inter and intra distances to align various components into a new 3D shape, ensuring that the components do not overlap and are closely fitted. Further, text templates are utilized to process the captions of each component and generate new text descriptions. Besides, we use unimodal encoders to extract embeddings for 3D shapes and texts based on the enriched dataset. We then calculate fine-grained cross-modal similarity using Earth MoverÂ’s Distance (EMD) and enhance cross-modal matching with contrastive learning, enabling bidirectional retrieval between texts and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments show our SCA3D outperforms previous works on the Text2Shape dataset, raising the Shape-to-Text RR@1 score from 20.03 to 27.22 and the Text-to-Shape RR@1 score from 13.12 to 16.67.

Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene.

Traditional range imaging setups, such as stereo or structured light cameras, face hassles including calibration, occlusions, and hardware demands, with accuracy limited by the baseline between cameras. Single- and multiview monocular depth offers a more compact alternative, but is constrained by the unobservability of the metric scale. Light field imaging provides a promising solution for estimating metric depth by using a unique lens configuration through a single device. However, its application to single-view dense metric depth is under-addressed mainly due to the technologyÂ’s high cost, the lack of public benchmarks, and proprietary geometrical models and software.
Our work explores the potential of focused plenoptic cameras for dense metric depth. We propose a novel pipeline that predicts metric depth from a single plenoptic camera shot by first generating a sparse metric point cloud using a neural network, which is then used to scale and align a dense relative depth map regressed by a foundation depth model, resulting in a dense metric depth. To validate it, we curated the Light Field & Stereo Image Dataset (LFS) of real-world light field images with stereo depth labels, filling a current gap in existing resources.

Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized feature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting and transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the informative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection (ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient anchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main components: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor proposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor confidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting only the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global fusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF) and global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF and SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion iteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate ACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the perception range and detection performances. We will make our code available.",,,,,,

However, a realistic yet challenging scenario: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for BEV, is still under-explored. A key ingredient for SDG is to increase data diversity via common image augmentation or adversarial data generation first. However, common image-level augmentation is not sufficient enough to ensure domain diversity in most part of latent space. The adversarial generation has the problem of unstable training or mode collapsing as well. To address these limitations, we present Tri-level Automatic Augmentation (Tri-AutoAug), a simple yet effective method to enlarge the diversity and quantity of data from image and 2D features and facilitate the model to learn more domain-invariant features in BEV space. Besides, Tri-AutoAug can automatically learn augmentation strategies to avoid spending too much time manually adjusting hyperparameters and maximize the benefit of Tri-level Augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore automatic augmentation for SDG BEV. Extensive experiments on NuScenes-C including eight testing domains have demonstrated that our approach can achieve the best performance across various domain generalization methods. More importantly, we evaluate the proposed method in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Tri-AutoAug improves the out-of-distribution (ood) performance by 8.54% (mAP), which demonstrates that Tri-AutoAug provides a practical and feasible solution for the applications of 3D detectors in the real world.The code is available at https://github.com/ClaireTun/Tri-AutoAug.",,,,,,
Learning Based Planning and Control,Motion Planning for Minimally-Actuated Serial Robots,"Cohen, Avi;Sintov, Avishai;Zarrouk, David","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Redundant Robots, Kinematics","Abstract: Modern manipulators are acclaimed for their precision but often struggle to operate in confined spaces. This limitation has driven the development of hyper-redundant and continuum robots. While these present unique advantages, they face challenges in, for instance, weight, mechanical complexity, modeling and costs. The Minimally Actuated Serial Robot (MASR) has been proposed as a light-weight, low-cost and simpler alternative where passive joints are actuated with a Mobile Actuator (MA) moving along the arm. Yet, Inverse Kinematics (IK) and a general motion planning algorithm for the MASR have not be addressed. In this letter, we propose the MASR-RRT* motion planning algorithm specifically developed for the unique kinematics of MASR. The main component of the algorithm is a data-based model for solving the IK problem while considering minimal traverse of the MA. The model is trained solely using the forward kinematics of the MASR and does not require real data. With the model as a local-connection mechanism, MASR-RRT* minimizes a cost function expressing the action time. In a comprehensive analysis, we show that MASR-RRT* is superior in performance to the straight-forward implementation of the standard RRT*. Experiments on a real robot in different environments with obstacles validate the proposed algorithm.",,,,,,

IBC utilizes human demonstration data to leverage the training speed of RL, and DMP serves as a heuristic model that transfers motion planning into a simpler planning space. To support this, we also create a human demonstration dataset using a pick-and-place experiment that can be used for similar studies.

Learning Based Planning and Control,Interpretable Active Inference Gait Control Learning,"Szadkowski, Rudolf;Faigl, Jan","Keywords: Bioinspired Robot Learning, Probabilistic Inference, Learning from Experience","Abstract: Sustaining the gait locomotion in an adversarial environment requires the robot to react to novel experiences adaptively. In Free Energy Principle (FEP), the behavioral reaction is driven by the discrepancy between observation and prediction. Although, for legged robot gait locomotion, the prediction of gait dynamics is challenging as the consequences non-linearly depend on the activity history, the animal gait is robust, adapting to severe motion disruptions seemingly instantly. In biomimetic robotics, the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) relaxes the general dynamics of body-environment interaction to the stable and repetitive dynamics of gait. Based on these observations, we propose self-learning of the gait dynamics model and FEP framework that infers state estimation and gait control. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on a real hexapod walking robot with 18 controllable degrees of freedom. The robot learns the gait dynamics model indoors and then deploys it in outdoor navigation under various adversarial scenarios.

Learning Based Planning and Control,DFM: Deep Fourier Mimic for Expressive Dance Motion Learning,"Watanabe, Ryo;Li, Chenhao;Hutter, Marco","Keywords: Learning from Demonstration, Reinforcement Learning, Art and Entertainment Robotics","Abstract: As entertainment robots gain popularity, the demand for natural and expressive motion, particularly in dancing, continues to rise. Traditionally, dancing motions have been manually designed by artists, a process that is both labor-intensive and restricted to simple motion playback,lacking the flexibility to incorporate additional tasks such as locomotion or gaze control during dancing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Deep Fourier Mimic (DFM), a novel method that combines advanced motion representation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable smooth transitions between motions while concurrently managing auxiliary tasks during dance sequences. While previous frequency domain based motion representations have successfully encoded dance motions into latent parameters, they often impose overly rigid periodic assumptions at the local level, resulting in reduced tracking accuracy and motion expressiveness, which is a critical aspect for entertainment robots. By relaxing these locally periodic constraints, our approach not only enhances tracking precision but also facilitates smooth transitions between different motions. Furthermore, the learned RL policy that supports simultaneous base activities, such as locomotion and gaze control, allows entertainment robots to engage more dynamically and interactively with users rather than merely replaying static, pre-designed dance routines.",,,,,,

Deep learning predictions are influenced by uncertainties in the data, termed as aleatoric uncertainties, as well as uncertainties in the learning process and model structure, known as epistemic uncertainties. The proposed algorithm, called as Calibrated Evidential Quantile Regression in Deep-Q Networks (CEQR-DQN), addresses key challenges associated with separately estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in stochastic robotic environments. It combines deep evidential learning with quantile calibration based on the principles of conformal inference to provide explicit, sample-free computations of global uncertainty as opposed to local estimates based on simple variance. Thereby, the proposed approach overcomes limitations of traditional methods in computational and statistical efficiency and handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) observations. Tested on a suite of representative miniaturized Atari games (i.e., MinAtar), CEQR-DQN is shown to surpass similar existing frameworks in scores and learning speed.

Learning Based Planning and Control,Teaching Periodic Stable Robot Motions Generation Via Sketch,"Zhi, Weiming;Tang, Haozhan;Zhang, Tianyi;Johnson-Roberson, Matthew","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Learning from Demonstration","Abstract: Contemporary robots are complex systems. Teaching novel motion patterns to robots requires specialised expertise, often entailing the careful specification of robot motion or the cumbersome design of optimisation problems. In this paper, we seek to simplify the process of generating periodic motions, by teaching robots with user sketches. In particular, we tackle the problem of teaching a robot to approach a surface and then follow cyclic motion on the surface. The limit cycle of the motion can be arbitrarily specified by a single user-provided sketch over an image from the robotÂ’s camera, and the sketched limit cycle is then projected into the scene. To generate motion that converges to the limit cycle, we contribute the Stable Periodic Diagrammatic Teaching (SPDT) framework. SPDT models the robotÂ’s motion as an Orbitally Asymptotically Stable (O.A.S.) dynamical system that learns to stabilise based on the diagrammatic sketch provided by the user. This is achieved by applying a differentiable and invertible function, known as a diffeomorphism, to shape a known O.A.S. system. The parameterised diffeomorphism is then optimised with respect to the Hausdorff distance between the limit cycle of our modelled system and the sketch, to produce the desired robot motion. We provide insight into the behaviour of the optimised system and empirically evaluate SPDT. Results show that we can diagrammatically teach complex cyclic motion patterns with accuracy.",,,,,,

However, existing novel view synthesis techniques rely on a single-volume radiance field with uniform spatial resolution, constraining their model capacity and resulting in artifacts in synthesized auto-driving views. This paper introduces AMVP, a novel neural representation that models auto-driving scenes using multiple local primitives with adaptive spatial resolution. AMVP addresses the lack of representation capability of detail-rich regions by adaptively subdividing the scene into multiple local volumes. Each local volume is assigned a tailored resolution based on its geometric complexity, as determined by a density prior. Subsequently, multi-volume primitives are introduced to enable sharing a global feature table among local volumes, addressing the GPU memory inefficiency caused by the duplicated allocation. In addition, the paper proposes resolution-aware confidence, a mechanism that suppresses artifacts arising from frequency ambiguity. This mechanism adaptively reduces high-frequency components based on the spatial resolution of each local volume and the distance of the sampling point from the optical center. Experimental results on benchmark auto-driving datasets demonstrate that the proposed AMVP achieves superior rendering quality while using a similar number of parameters compared to existing methods.",,,,,,

By initially training on large datasets and subsequently fine-tuning on task-specific data, pre-training provides a solid foundation for models, improving generalization abilities and accelerating convergence rates. This approach has seen significant success in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. However, traditional pre-training methods necessitate large datasets and substantial computational resources, and they can only learn shared features through prolonged training and struggle to capture deeper, task-specific features. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented pre-training method that begins with generating redundant segmentation proposals using the Segment Anything (SAM) model. We then introduce a Specific Category Enhancement Fine-tuning (SCEF) strategy for fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to select proposals most closely related to the drivable area from those generated by SAM. This approach can generate a lot of coarse training data for pre-training models, which are further fine-tuned using manually annotated data, thereby improving model's performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the KITTI road dataset demonstrate that our task-oriented pre-training method achieves an all-around performance improvement compared to models without pre-training.

Existing graph-based collision prediction methods rely heavily on domain knowledge and predefined semantic relations, limiting their flexibility and adaptability in complex driving scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel collision prediction framework named HGAT-CP, which integrates a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) with a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to model the spatial-temporal interactions in scenes. First, the proposed method employs a data-driven scene graph embedding module to autonomously learn relationships between vehicles and lanes and construct flexible scene graphs. Then, the HGAT module utilizes a dual-level attention mechanism, operating at both the node level and type level, to capture spatial interactions without relying on predefined semantic rules. The LSTM module models temporal dependencies of the scene graph embeddings to improve the prediction of collision events over time.

Related research leveraging learning-based methodologies has yielded notable success on various benchmark trajectory datasets. However, these models often experience performance degradation when faced with dynamic changes in traffic conditions such as vehicle density, road types, and weather conditions, as they have not been exposed to these variations during the training process. To effectively address the need for real-time adaptation in dynamic traffic scenarios, we propose a novel framework titled self-evolving spatial-temporal directed graph neural network (SE-STDGNN). This model utilizes evolving graph convolution networks (EvolveGCNs) to aggregate spatial-temporal features of vehicles and their neighbors, which are then utilized by a trajectory prediction module to forecast future trajectories. Further, a self-evolving mechanism is introduced to adjust model parameters dynamically in the real-time operation.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

One of the most promising approaches for localization on object maps is to use semantic graph matching using landmark descriptors calculated from the distribution of surrounding objects. These descriptors are vulnerable to misclassification and partial observations. Moreover, many existing methods rely on inlier extraction using RANSAC, which is stochastic and prone to a high outlier rate. To address the former issue, we augment the correspondence matching using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Landmark discriminability is improved by VLM embeddings, which are independent of surrounding objects. In addition, inliers are estimated deterministically using a graph-theoretic approach. We also incorporate

However, these procedures can incur significant costs in terms of inference, storage, and updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent complex local descriptors and their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a simple outdoor dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in scene-specific generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our approach outperforms the previous regression-based methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Therefore, most offroad vehicles are currently limited to driving only at low speeds to assure vehicle stability and safety. In this work, we aim at empowering high-speed off-road vehicles with competence awareness in SE(3) so that they can reason about the consequences of taking aggressive maneuvers on different terrain with a 6-DoF forward kino- dynamic model.

As a vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, high-speed and varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions. In this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a pre- trained visual foundation model (VFM) such as DINOv2, which provides rich features that encode fine-grained semantic infor- mation.

However, existing methods mainly use the traditional method to densify the sparse LiDAR data in the perspective view, which introduces noise and limits the representation ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end freespace detection network with cascaded LiDAR-camera fusion and multi-scale self-distillation. It first performs sparse freespace detection in the range view, and then projects the range-view features onto the perspective view and densifies them. The dense features obtained are fused with camera images to get the final freespace detection results. In our method, the cascaded fusion strategy reduces the impact of resolution differences between LiDAR point clouds and camera images, and the introduction of noise during the data densification process. The multi-scale self-distillation strategy distills knowledge from the LiDAR-camera fusion module to the perspective-view module to further improve the freespace detection performance using LiDAR data only. Experiments on the off-road ORFD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cascaded fusion and multi-scale self-distillation strategies, our method obtains 93.4% IoU at speeds of more than 50 Hz.

This strategy is based on the traditional two-loop control scheme where the inner loop controls the angular velocity, and the outer loop controls the vehicleÂ’s attitude based on quaternions. In the quaternion-based controller, usually, the convergence rate increases when the quaternion starts closer to its equilibrium point, thus making it challenging to design a linear controller for the inner loop. To overcome this, we propose a nonlinear control with a varying gain for the outer loop that ensures the quaternion has a fixed convergence rate. We propose the control design of the inner loop, which consists of a disturbance observer (DOB) and a linear controller. The DOB is optimally designed to minimize external disturbances in the presence of model uncertainties. With the DOB, a linear controller is designed for the inner loop, guaranteeing robust stability and performance against the model and actuator parameter uncertainties. The results of experimental flights are reported in this paper.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots 3,Flying through Moving Gates without Full State Estimation,"RÃ¶mer, Ralf;Emmert, Tim;Schoellig, Angela P.","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: Autonomous drone racing requires powerful perception, planning, and control and has become a benchmark and test field for autonomous, agile flight. Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that operates without a race track map or VIO, relying solely on monocular measurements of the line of sight to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can navigate through moving gates at high speeds while being robust to different gate movements, model errors, wind, and delays.",,,,,,

The Collapsible Airfoil Single Actuator ROtor-craft (CASARO) is a single actuator monocopter that derives its geometric properties from the Samara seed. CASARO achieves better flight efficiency, lift, and handling ergonomics by reducing its overall volume by 91.7% when collapsed and stowed. Unlike conventional rotorcraft, CASARO uses a non-rigid fabric wing to produce lift in flight. It utilizes the robotÂ’s rotational velocity to maintain tension within its fabric and airframe, providing adequate lift during its hover state. The conception, design, construction, and control of the soft monowing are demonstrated, including its capability to reduce its footprint with its soft fabric construction. To analyze the flight dynamics of CASARO, the craft is flown indoors autonomously, tracking its wing surface, craft body attitude, and position with various step inputs to observe different wing dynamics. CASARO is also capable of being deployed outdoors for real-life human-operated flight.",,,,,,

This process is essential to establish proper initial conditions for missions in the real world. We evaluate the performance of three synchronization algorithms using a setup of continuously moving fixed-wing drones randomly placed around a loitering circle. We consider the algorithm based on distributed consensus as a baseline. We propose two methods: the Minimum Of Shortest Arc (MOSA) algorithm that outperforms the baseline in this setup and Firefly multi-Pulse Synchronization (FPS), which is inspired by firefly synchronization. The latter method requires 10 times less communication while maintaining a performance comparable to the baseline. These algorithms were first tested in a simple simulation, then a more realistic simulation environment using Gazebo in which fixed-wing dynamics are considered. The proposed algorithms are rigorously tested in simulation through multiple trials involving a group of 10 UAVs, confirming the effectiveness of our approaches.

However, in contrast with their bigger counterparts, i.e., kg-scale drones, nano-drones expose three orders of magnitude less onboard memory and compute power, demanding more efficient and lightweight vision-based pipelines to win the race. This work presents a map-free vision-based (using only a monocular camera) autonomous nano-drone that combines a real-time deep learning gate detection front-end with a classic yet elegant and effective visual servoing control back-end, only relying on onboard resources. Starting from two state-of-the-art tiny deep learning models, we adapt them for our specific task, and after a mixed simulator-real-world training, we integrate and deploy them aboard our nano-drone.

Such attributes make these vehicles ideally suited for long-range or high-speed reconnaissance operations and position them as valuable complementary members of a heterogeneous multi-robot team. However, these vehicles have traditionally been severely limited with regards to both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) as well as maneuverability, which greatly restricts their utility in environments characterized by complex obstacle fields (e.g., forests or urban centers).
This paper describes a set of algorithms and hardware advancements that enable agile fixed-wing UAVs to operate as members of a swarm in complex urban environments. At the core of our approach is a direct nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm that is capable of controlling fixed-wing UAVs through aggressive post-stall maneuvers.

For example, navigation relies on root velocity or position tracking, while tabletop manipulation prioritizes upper-body joint angle tracking. Existing approaches typically train individual policies tailored to a specific command space, limiting their transferability across modes. We present the key insight that full-body kinematic motion imitation can serve as a common abstraction for all these tasks and provide general-purpose motor skills for learning multiple modes of whole-body control. Building on this, we propose HOVER (Humanoid Versatile Controller), a multi-mode policy distillation framework that consolidates diverse control modes into a unified policy. HOVER enables seamless transitions between control modes while preserving the distinct advantages of each, offering a robust and scalable solution for humanoid control across a wide range of modes.

However, incorporating perceptual signals often introduces additional disturbances to the system, potentially reducing its robustness, generalizability, and efficiency. This paper presents the Perceptive Internal Model (PIM), which relies on onboard, continuously updated elevation maps centered around the robot to perceive its surroundings. We train the policy using ground-truth obstacle heights surrounding the robot in simulation, optimizing it based on the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM), and perform inference with heights sampled from the constructed elevation map. Unlike previous methods that directly encode depth maps or raw point clouds, our approach allows the robot to perceive the terrain beneath its feet clearly and is less affected by camera movement or noise. Furthermore, since depth map rendering is not required in simulation, our method introduces minimal additional computational costs and can train the policy in 3 hours on an RTX 4090 GPU.

Therefore, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approaches are often limited to reduced-order models. Sampling-based MPC has shown potential in nonconvex even discontinuous problems, but often yields suboptimal solutions with high variance, which limits its applications in high-dimensional locomotion. This work introduces DIAL-MPC (Diffusion-Inspired Annealing for Legged MPC), a sampling-based MPC framework with a novel diffusion-style annealing process. Such an annealing process is supported by the theoretical landscape analysis of Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) and the connection between MPPI and single-step diffusion. Algorithmically, DIAL-MPC iteratively refines solutions online and achieves both global coverage and local convergence. In quadrupedal torque-level control tasks, DIAL-MPC reduces the tracking error of standard MPPI by 13.4 times and outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) policies by 50% in challenging climbing tasks without any training. In particular, DIAL-MPC enables precise real-world quadrupedal jumping with payload.

Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for such an ability for the extended workspace and robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) a learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body tele-operation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or analytical planner and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an LLM planner that interfaces and coordinates these skills. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based control approach consisting of model learning and model predictive control (MPC) utilizing a variable-frequency scheme. Compared to existing MPC techniques, we learn a model directly from experiments, accounting not only for leg dynamics but also for modeling errors and unknown dynamics mismatch in hardware and during contact. Additionally, learning the model with variable-frequency allows us to cover the entire flight phase and final jumping target, enhancing the prediction accuracy of the jumping trajectory. Using the learned model, we also design variable-frequency to effectively leverage different jumping phases and track the target accurately. In a total of 92 jumps on Unitree A1 robot hardware, we verify that our approach outperforms other MPCs using fixed-frequency or nominal model, reducing the jumping distance error 2 to 8 times.

Secondly, we randomly initialize multiple prototypes and update the nearest prototype upon the arrival of instance, to preserve intra-class diversity. Thirdly, we propose a novel Label-guided Adaptive Updating. We separate the prototype updates from the representation optimization and exploit the label indexes to directly implement the prediction feedback.

Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D images as long as we can identify the same instance from different input frames.

In that direction, VISOR acts as a perception mediator, classifying everything a robot encounters in a scene as either known or unknown. It further identifies potential distractors (e.g., background elements), known categories, or objects specified through text seeds. By leveraging recent advancements in vision foundation models, VISOR operates in a training-free manner. It begins by segmenting a scene into its constituent entities, regardless of familiarity, and then extracts robust visual representations for each one. These representations are compared against an adaptive memory system that evolves over time; unknown objects are assigned unique IDs and added to this memory as new classes, enriching the robot's understanding of its environment. We argue that this evolving memory can facilitate guided exploration through prior knowledge, enhancing the efficiency of robotic exploration, and validate this by designing two exploration scenarios and running both simulated and real-world experiments.",,,,,,

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

Representation Learning 4,Data-Driven Dynamics Modeling of Miniature Robotic Blimps Using Neural ODEs with Parameter Auto-Tuning,"Zhu, Yongjian;Cheng, Hao;Zhang, Feitian","Keywords: Dynamics, Calibration and Identification, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Miniature robotic blimps, as one type of lighter-than-air aerial vehicles, have attracted increasing attention in the science and engineering community for their enhanced safety, extended endurance, and quieter operation compared to quadrotors. Accurately modeling the dynamics of these robotic blimps poses a significant challenge due to the complex aerodynamics stemming from their large lifting bodies. Traditional first-principle models have difficulty obtaining accurate aerodynamic parameters and often overlook high-order nonlinearities, thus coming to their limit in modeling the motion dynamics of miniature robotic blimps. To tackle this challenge, this letter proposes the Auto-tuning Blimp-oriented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation method (ABNODE), a data-driven approach that integrates first-principle and neural network modeling. Spiraling motion experiments of robotic blimps are conducted, comparing the ABNODE with first-principle and other data-driven benchmark models, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",,,,,,
Motion Planning and Control,Improving the Performance of Learned Controllers in Behavior Trees Using Value Function Estimates at Switching Boundaries,"KartaÂšev, Mart;Ogren, Petter","Keywords: Behavior-Based Systems, Control Architectures and Programming, Integrated Planning and Learning","Abstract: Behavior trees represent a modular way to create an overall controller from a set of sub-controllers solving different sub-problems. These sub-controllers can be created using various methods, such as classical
model based control or reinforcement learning (RL). If each sub-controller satisfies the preconditions of the next sub-controller, the overall controller will achieve the overall goal. However, even if all sub-controllers are locally optimal in achieving the preconditions of the next, with respect to some performance metric such as completion
time, the overall controller might still be far from optimal with respect to the same performance metric. In this paper we show how the performance
of the overall controller can be improved if we use approximations of value functions to inform the design of a sub-controller of the needs of the next one. We also show how, under certain assumptions, this leads to a globally optimal controller when the process is executed on all sub-controllers. Finally, this result also holds when some of the sub-controllers are already given, i.e., if we are constrained to use some existing sub-controllers the overall controller will be globally optimal given this constraint.",,,,,,

Motion Planning and Control,Robot Navigation in Unknown and Cluttered Workspace with Dynamical System Modulation in Starshaped Roadmap,"Chen, Kai;Liu, Haichao;Li, Yulin;Duan, Jianghua;Zhu, Lei;Ma, Jun","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Control, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: Compared to conventional decomposition methods that use ellipses or polygons to represent free space, starshaped representation can better capture the natural distribution of sensor data, thereby exploiting a larger portion of traversable space. This paper introduces a novel motion planning and control framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered environments using a dynamically constructed starshaped roadmap. Our approach generates a starshaped representation of the surrounding free space from real-time sensor data using piece-wise polynomials. Additionally, an incremental roadmap maintaining the connectivity information is constructed, and a searching algorithm efficiently selects short-term goals on this roadmap. Importantly, this framework addresses deadend situations with a graph updating mechanism. To ensure safe and efficient movement within the starshaped roadmap, we propose a reactive controller based on Dynamic System Modulation (DSM). This controller facilitates smooth motion within starshaped regions and their intersections, avoiding conservative and short-sighted behaviors and allowing the system to handle intricate obstacle configurations in unknown and cluttered environments. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher success rates and reduced travel times compared to other methods. It effectively manages intricate obstacle configurations, avoiding conservative and myopic behaviors.",,,,,,
Motion Planning and Control,Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving Via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion Predictions,"Zhao, Albert;Soatto, Stefano","Keywords: Planning under Uncertainty, Robot Safety, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.",,,,,,
Motion Planning and Control,No Plan but Everything under Control: Robustly Solving Sequential Tasks with Dynamically Composed Gradient Descent,"Mengers, Vito;Brock, Oliver","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Control, Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: We introduce a novel gradient-based approach for solving sequential tasks by dynamically adjusting the underlying myopic potential field in response to feedback and the world's regularities. This adjustment implicitly considers subgoals encoded in these regularities, enabling the solution of long sequential tasks, as demonstrated by solving the traditional planning domain of Blocks WorldÂ—without any planning. Unlike conventional planning methods, our feedback-driven approach adapts to uncertain and dynamic environments, as demonstrated by one hundred real-world trials involving drawer manipulation. These experiments highlight the robustness of our method compared to planning and show how interactive perception and error recovery naturally emerge from gradient descent without explicitly implementing them. This offers a computationally efficient alternative to planning for a variety of sequential tasks, while aligning with observations on biological problem-solving strategies.",,,,,,
Motion Planning and Control,Autonomous Navigation in Ice-Covered Waters with Learned Predictions on Ship-Ice Interactions,"Zhong, Ninghan;Potenza, Alessandro;Smith, Stephen L.","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Marine Robotics, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: Autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters poses significant challenges due to the frequent lack of viable collision-free trajectories. When complete obstacle avoidance is infeasible, it becomes imperative for the navigation strategy to minimize collisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ice, which moves in response to ship maneuvers, complicates the path planning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model to estimate the coarse dynamics of ice movements triggered by ship actions through occupancy estimation. To ensure real-time applicability, we propose a novel approach that caches intermediate prediction results and seamlessly integrates the predictive model into a graph search planner. We evaluate the proposed planner in both simulation and in a physical testbed against existing approaches and show that our planner significantly reduces collisions with ice when compared to the state-of-the-art.

Motion Planning and Control,IKap: Kinematics-Aware Planning with Imperative Learning,"Li, Qihang;Chen, Zhuoqun;Zheng, Haoze;He, Haonan;Zhan, Zitong;Su, Shaoshu;Geng, Junyi;Wang, Chen","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Collision Avoidance, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems have gained increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly works with various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex environments.",,,,,,

We improve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the following respects. We show that our learned policy outperforms existing SOTA in terms of occlusion/collision avoidance capabilities and computation time. Second, we present an extensive ablation showing how different components of our learning pipeline contribute to the overall tracking task. We also demonstrate the real-time performance of our approach on resource-constrained hardware such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

Multi-Robot Planning,Multi-Horizon Multi-Agent Planning Using Decentralised Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Seiler, Konstantin M;Kong, Felix Honglim;Fitch, Robert","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents","Abstract: We propose multi-horizon Monte Carlo tree search (MH-MCTS), the first framework for integrated hierarchical multi-horizon, multi-agent planning based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The method employs multiple simultaneous MCTS optimisations for each planning level within each agent, which are designed to optimise a joint objective function. Using concepts from decentralised Monte Carlo tree search (Dec-MCTS), the individual optimisations continuously exchange information about their current plans. This breaks the common top-down only information flow within the planning hierarchy and allows higher level optimisers to consider progress made by lower level planners. The method is implemented for survey missions using a fleet of ground robots. Simulation results with different mission profiles show substantial performance improvements of the new method of up to 59% compared to traditional MCTS and Dec-MCTS.",,,,,,

Multi-Robot Planning,HULK: Large-Scale Hierarchical Coordination under Continual and Uncertain Temporal Tasks,"Luo, Qingyuan;Li, Jie;Guo, Meng","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Task and Motion Planning, Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Multi-agent systems can be extremely efficient when working concurrently and collaboratively, e.g., for delivery, surveillance, search and rescue. Coordination of such teams often involves two aspects: (i) selecting appropriate subteams for different tasks in various areas; (ii) coordinating agents in the subteams to execute the associated subtasks. Existing work often assumes that the tasks are static and known beforehand, where an integer program can be formulated and solved offline.However, in many applications, the team-wise tasks are generated online continually by external requests; and the amount of subtasks within each task is uncertain (e.g., the number of packages to deliver, and victims to rescue). The aforementioned offline solution becomes inadequate as it would require constant re-computation for the whole team and global communication to broadcast the results. Thus, this work tackles the large-scale coordination problem under continual and uncertain temporal tasks, specified as temporal logic formulas over collaborative actions. The proposed hierarchical framework (HULK) consists of two interleaved layers: the rolling assignment of currently-known tasks to sub-teams within a certain horizon, and the dynamic coordination within a sub-team given the detected subtasks during online execution. Thus, the coordination is performed hierarchically at different granularities and triggering conditions, to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. It is validated rigorously over large-scale heterogeneous systems under various temporal tasks and environment uncertainties.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Planning,COHERENT: Collaboration of Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System with Large Language Models,"Liu, Kehui;Tang, Zixin;Wang, Dong;Wang, Zhigang;Li, Xuelong;Zhao, Bin","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Cooperating Robots","Abstract: Leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), recent LLM-based robot task planning methods yield promising results. However, they mainly focus on single or multiple homogeneous robots on simple tasks. Practically, complex long-horizon tasks always require collaboration among multiple heterogeneous robots especially with more complex action spaces, which makes these tasks more challenging. To this end, we propose COHERENT, a novel LLM-based task planning framework for collaboration of heterogeneous multi-robot systems including quadrotors, robotic dogs, and robotic arms. Specifically, a Proposal-Execution-Feedback-Adjustment (PEFA) mechanism is designed to decompose and assign actions for individual robots, where a centralized task assigner makes a task planning proposal to decompose the complex task into subtasks, and then assigns subtasks to robot executors. Each robot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and reports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The PEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging heterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex long-horizon tasks. The experimental results show that our work surpasses the previous methods by a large margin in terms of success rate and execution efficiency.

Multi-Robot Planning,FlyKites: Human-Centric Interactive Exploration and Assistance under Limited Communication,"Zhang, Yuyang;Tian, Zhuoli;Wei, Jinsheng;Guo, Meng","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Task and Motion Planning, Human-Robot Teaming","Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects, temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks, especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication. It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration and intermittent communication (called the ``spread mode""), where the robots collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles (called the ``relay mode""), such that all requested assistance can be provided with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator adaptively.

Multi-Robot Planning,Work Smarter Not Harder: Simple Imitation Learning with CS-PIBT Outperforms Large-Scale Imitation Learning for MAPF,"Veerapaneni, Rishi;Jakobsson, Arthur;Ren, Kevin;Kim, Samuel;Li, Jiaoyang;Likhachev, Maxim","Keywords: Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Motion and Path Planning, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of effectively finding efficient collision-free paths for a group of agents in a shared workspace. The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large-scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large-scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does not produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF policy in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should always (1) use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g. CS-PIBT) and (2) include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT), as well as (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved.",,,,,,
Agile Legged Locomotion,Mastering Agile Jumping Skills from Simple Practices with Iterative Learning Control,"Nguyen, Chuong;Bao, Lingfan;Nguyen, Quan","Keywords: Legged Robots, Learning from Experience, Model Learning for Control","Abstract: Achieving precise target jumping with legged robots poses a significant challenge due to the long flight phase and the uncertainties inherent in contact dynamics and hardware. Forcefully attempting these agile motions on hardware could result in severe failures and potential damage. Motivated by this challenge, we propose an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) approach to learn and refine jumping skills from easy to difficult, instead of directly learning these challenging tasks. We verify that learning from simplicity can enhance safety and target jumping accuracy over trials. Compared to other ILC approaches for legged locomotion, our method can tackle the problem of a long flight phase where control input is not available. In addition, our approach allows the robot to apply what it learns from a simple jumping task to accomplish more challenging tasks within a few trials directly in hardware, instead of learning from scratch. We validate the method through extensive experiments on the A1 model and hardware for various tasks. Starting from a small jump (e.g., a forward jump 40cm), our learning approach empowers the robot to accomplish a variety of challenging targets, including jumping onto a 20cm high box, leaping to a greater distance of up to 60cm, as well as performing jumps while carrying an unknown payload of 2kg.

Agile Legged Locomotion,High Accuracy Aerial Maneuvers on Legged Robots Using Variational Integrator Discretized Trajectory Optimization,"Beck, Scott;Nguyen, Chuong;Duong, Thai;Atanasov, Nikolay;Nguyen, Quan","Keywords: Legged Robots, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: Performing acrobatic maneuvers involving long aerial phases, such as precise dives or multiple backflips from significant heights, remains an open challenge in legged robot autonomy. Such aggressive motions often require accurate state predictions over long horizons with multiple contacts and extended flight phases. Most existing trajectory optimization (TO) methods rely on Euler or Runge-Kutta integration, which can accumulate significant prediction errors over long planning horizons. In this work, we propose a novel whole-body TO method using variational integration (VI) and full-body nonlinear dynamics for long-flight aggressive maneuvers. Compared to traditional Euler-based TO, our approach using VI preserves energy and momentum properties of the continuous time system and reduces error between predicted and executed trajectories by factors of between 2 âˆ?10 while achieving similar planning time. We successfully demonstrate long-flight triple backflips on a quadruped A1 robot model and backflips on a bipedal HECTOR robot model for various heights and distances, achieving landing angle errors of only a few degrees. In contrast, TO with Euler integration fails to achieve accurate landings in equivalent circumstances, e.g., with landing angle errors greater than 90â—?for triple backflips.

Up to now, there were no formal guarantees on their number, or even their existence, according to the considered configuration. In this work, a formal approach is presented for the exhaustive computation of all minima and unstable equilibria for a class of six well-known image- based visual servoing controllers. This approach relies on a new polynomial formulation of the equilibrium condition that avoids using the camera pose. By using modern computational algebraic geometry methods and an ad hoc symmetry breaking strategy, the formal resolution of this new equilibrium condition is rendered computationally feasible. The proposed methodology is applied to compute the equilibria of several classical visual servoing tasks, with planar and non-planar configurations of four and five points. The effects of local minima and saddle points on the dynamics of the system are finally illustrated through intensive simulation results, as well as the effects of image noise and uncertainties on depths.",,,,,,

However, the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics and controllers make tuning a challenging task when it is done by hand. We present DiffTune, a novel, gradient-based automatic tuning framework. We formulate the controller tuning as a parameter optimization problem and update the controller parameters through gradient-based optimization. The gradient is obtained using sensitivity propagation, which is the only method for gradient computation when tuning for a physical system instead of its simulated counterpart. Furthermore, we use L1 adaptive control to compensate for the uncertainties so that the gradient is not biased by the unmodelled uncertainties. We validate the DiffTune in simulation and compare it with state-of-the-art auto-tuning methods, where DiffTune achieves the best performance in a more efficient manner. Experiments on auto-tuning a nonlinear controller for quadrotor show promising results, where DiffTune achieves 3.5x tracking error reduction on an aggressive trajectory in only 10 trials over a 12-dimensional controller par",,,,,,
Visual Servoing and Tracking,Output Feedback with Feedforward Robust Control for Motion Systems Driven by Nonlinear Position-Dependent Actuators (I),"Al Saaideh, Mohammad;Boker, Almuatazbellah;Al Janaideh, Mohammad","Keywords: Actuation and Joint Mechanisms, Motion Control","Abstract: This paper introduces a control approach for a motion system driven by a class of actuators with multiple nonlinearities. The proposed approach presents a combination of a feedforward controller and an output feedback controller to enhance the tracking performance of the motion system. The feedforward controller is mainly proposed to address the actuator dynamics and provide a linearization of the actuator without requiring measurements from the actuator. Subsequently, the output feedback controller is designed using the measured position to achieve a tracking objective for a desired reference signal, considering the unknown nonlinearities in the system and the error due to the open-loop compensation using feedforward control. The efficacy of the proposed control approach is validated through three applications: reluctance actuator, electrostatic microactuator, and magnetic levitation system. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in achieving the desired reference signal with minimal tracking error, considering that the actuator and system nonlinearities are unknown.",,,,,,

Event cameras offer a promising alternative due to their high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present FACET (Fast and Accurate Event-based Eye Tracking), an end-to-end neural network that directly outputs pupil ellipse parameters from event data, optimized for real-time XR applications. The ellipse output can be directly used in subsequent ellipse-based pupil trackers. We enhance the EV-Eye dataset by expanding annotated data and converting original mask labels to ellipse-based annotations to train the model. Besides, a novel trigonometric loss is adopted to address angle discontinuities and a fast causal event volume event representation method is put forward. On the enhanced EV-Eye test set, FACET achieves an average pupil center error of 0.20 pixels and an inference time of 0.53 ms, reducing pixel error and inference time by 1.6x and 1.8x compared to the prior art, EV-Eye, with 4.4x and 11.7x less parameters and arithmetic operations.

Visual Servoing and Tracking,EMoE-Tracker: Environmental MoE-Based Transformer for Robust Event-Guided Object Tracking,"Chen, Yucheng;Wang, Lin","Keywords: Visual Tracking, Sensor Fusion, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, no interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features for better interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Gating to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that fine-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to improve interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.",,,,,,
Manipulating Challenging Objects,Learning Keypoints for Robotic Cloth Manipulation Using Synthetic Data,"Lips, Thomas;De Gusseme, Victor-Louis;Wyffels, Francis","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Data Sets for Robotic Vision, Simulation and Animation","Abstract: Assistive robots should be able to wash, fold or iron clothes. However, due to the variety, deformability and self-occlusions of clothes, creating robot systems for cloth manipulation is challenging. Synthetic data is a promising direction to improve generalization, but the sim-to-real gap limits its effectiveness. To advance the use of synthetic data for cloth manipulation tasks such as robotic folding, we present a synthetic data pipeline to train keypoint detectors for almost- flattened cloth items. To evaluate its performance, we have also collected a real-world dataset. We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64% and an average keypoint distance of 18 pixels. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance to 74% mAP and an average distance of only 9 pixels. Furthermore, we describe failure modes of the keypoint detectors and compare different approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials. We also quantify the remaining sim- to-real gap and argue that further improvements to the fidelity of cloth assets will be required to further reduce this gap. The code, dataset and trained models are available online.",,,,,,

It is essential for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings. However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation.

Especially for unstructured outdoor environments, very few datasets exist for even fewer robotic platforms and scenarios. In an earlier work, we presented the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE) framework along with 10000 multimodal frames from an offroad vehicle to enhance the perception capabilities in unstructured environments. In this work, we address the generalizability of the GOOSE framework. To accomplish this, we open-source the GOOSE-Ex dataset, which contains additional 5000 labeled multimodal frames from various completely different environments, recorded on a robotic excavator and a quadruped platform. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the semantic segmentation performance on different platforms and sensor modalities in unseen environments.

Manipulating Challenging Objects,Robotic Framework for Iterative and Adaptive Profile Grading of Sand,"Hanut, Louis;Du, Yurui;Vande Moere, Andrew;Detry, Renaud;Bruyninckx, Herman","Keywords: Robotics and Automation in Construction, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: This paper studies sand profile grading, a manipulation task to obtain a desired geometric curve in sand. Manipulating sand is challenging because like other amorphous materials, its properties are difficult to estimate and emergent effects such as collapses may occur which both influence the manipulation outcome. To tackle these challenges, humans iterate and adapt their manual actions to the observed material states. In this paper, we propose to replicate this adaptive and iterative approach on a robotic profile grading task. Our results demonstrate that (1) tool insertion adaptation reduces force limit violations during tool-material interactions, (2) grading angle adaptation ensures no undercutting or collisions while allowing for cutting or smoothing the sand profile, and (3) adapting progress speed to task evolution provides a balance between grading precision and execution time.

This paper presents a novel robotic framework that leverages diffusion-based self-supervised imitation learning from imperfect visual servoing demonstrations to achieve safe and precise glass installation. Specifically, our approach employs noisy and suboptimal demonstration data obtained via visual servoing to train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This model iteratively refines installation trajectories, transforming them into smooth, precise, and collision-free movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses conventional visual servoing and standard imitation learning baselines in terms of success rate, precision, and installation efficiency, while markedly improving operational safety.

Manipulating Challenging Objects,A Global-Local Graph Attention Network for Deformable Linear Objects Dynamic Interaction with Environment,"Chu, Jian;Zhang, Wenkang;Ouyang, Bo;Tian, Kunmiao;Zhang, Shuai;Zhai, Kai","Keywords: Dynamics, Collision Avoidance, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Accurately modeling the interactions between deformable linear objects (DLOs) and their environments is crucial for active deformation control by robot manipulators. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown immense potential in particle-based simulation of DLOs. However, most existing studies propagate particle information in sequence, ignoring that particle motions, including the distal particle, correlate strongly with each other and the interaction state. In this paper, a global and local attention dynamic simulation model named GladSim is designed based on GNNs and the attention mechanism to aggregate information among particles and focus on the interaction particles for DLO interaction with the environment. Specifically, a global virtual node is proposed to deliver particle information and shorten the propagation path for the first time, which connects all the particles and aggregates global information. When the DLOs and the obstacle boundary particles are close, an edge is established between them to capture the interaction state. Moreover, we group all the particles by k-hop neighbors and design a HopSA module that combines hop attention and self-attention to discover the correlates among adjacent particles. Experimental results on simulation and real-world data show that the proposed GladSim network's predictive accuracy significantly outperforms baseline models, especially in long-term prediction.",,,,,,
Social Navigation 2,Generating Causal Explanations of Vehicular Agent Behavioural Interactions with Learnt Reward Profiles,"Howard, Rhys Peter Matthew;Hawes, Nick;Kunze, Lars","Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems, AI-Enabled Robotics, Agent-Based Systems","Abstract: Transparency and explainability are important features that responsible autonomous vehicles should possess, particularly when interacting with humans, and causal reasoning offers a strong basis to provide these qualities. However, even if one assumes agents act to maximise some concept of reward, it is difficult to make accurate causal inferences of agent planning without capturing what is of importance to the agent. Thus our work aims to learn a weighting of reward metrics for agents such that explanations for agent interactions can be causally inferred. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively across three real-world driving datasets, demonstrating a functional improvement over previous methods and competitive performance across evaluation metrics.",,,,,,
Social Navigation 2,Fast Online Learning of CLiFF-Maps in Changing Environments,"Zhu, Yufei;Rudenko, Andrey;Palmieri, Luigi;Heuer, Lukas;Lilienthal, Achim J.;Magnusson, Martin",Keywords: Human Detection and Tracking,"Abstract: Maps of dynamics are effective representations of motion patterns learned from prior observations, with recent research demonstrating their ability to enhance various downstream tasks such as human-aware robot navigation, long-term human motion prediction, and robot localization. Current advancements have primarily concentrated on methods for learning maps of human flow in environments where the flow is static, i.e., not assumed to change over time. In this paper we propose an online update method of the CLiFF-map (an advanced map of dynamics type that models motion patterns as velocity and orientation mixtures) to actively detect and adapt to human flow changes. As new observations are collected, our goal is to update a CLiFF-map to effectively and accurately integrate them, while retaining relevant historic motion patterns. The proposed online update method maintains a probabilistic representation in each observed location, updating parameters by continuously tracking sufficient statistics. In experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method is able to maintain accurate representations of human motion dynamics, contributing to high performance flow-compliant planning downstream tasks, while being orders of magnitude faster than the comparable baselines.",,,,,,
Social Navigation 2,A Hybrid Approach to Indoor Social Navigation: Integrating Reactive Local Planning and Proactive Global Planning,"Debnath, Arnab;Stein, Gregory;Kosecka, Jana","Keywords: Human-Aware Motion Planning, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: We consider the problem of indoor building-scale social navigation, where the robot must reach a point goal as quickly as possible without colliding with humans who are freely moving around. Factors such as varying crowd densities, unpredictable human behavior, and the constraints of indoor spaces add significant complexity to the navigation task, necessitating a more advanced approach. We propose a modular navigation framework that leverages the strengths of both classical methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach employs a global planner to generate waypoints, assigning soft costs around anticipated pedestrian locations, encouraging caution around potential future positions of humans. Simultaneously, the local planner, powered by DRL, follows these waypoints while avoiding collisions. The combination of these planners enables the agent to perform complex maneuvers and effectively navigate crowded and constrained environments while improving reliability. Many existing studies on social navigation are conducted in simplistic or open environments, limiting the ability of trained models to perform well in complex, real-world settings. To advance research in this area, we introduce a new 2D benchmark designed to facilitate development and testing of social navigation strategies in indoor environments. We benchmark our method against traditional and RL-based navigation strategies, demonstrating that our approach outperforms both.",,,,,,

To test our framework, we implemented SRN behaviors on an autonomous robot in a passing scenario and conducted an online study where participants ranked videos of different SRN behavior combinations. Our findings show that incorporating all three principles enhances SRN, with social norms having the greatest impact.",,,,,,

Many existing methods decouple prediction from planning, which does not account for the interaction between robot and human motions and can lead to the robot getting stuck. We propose SICNav, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that jointly solves for robot motion and predicted crowd motion in closed-loop. We model each human in the crowd to be following an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) scheme and embed that model as a constraint in the robotÂ’s local planner, resulting in a bilevel nonlinear MPC optimization problem. We use a KKT- reformulation to cast the bilevel problem as a single level and use a nonlinear solver to optimize. Our MPC method can influence pedestrian motion while explicitly satisfying safety constraints in a single-robot multi-human environment. We analyze the performance of SICNav in two simulation environments and indoor experiments with a real robot to demonstrate safe robot motion that can influence the surrounding humans. We also validate the trajectory forecasting performance of ORCA on a human trajectory dataset.",,,,,,

While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120K surgical instrument instances of 6 categories as shown in Fig. 1.

By relying on a coarse dynamic Finite Element Model (FEM), we have successfully formulated the analytical relationship expressing the motion of the feature points to the six degrees of freedom (6~DOF) motion of a robot gripper. From this modeling step, a novel closed-loop deformation controller is designed. To be robust against model approximations, the whole shape of the object is tracked in real-time using an RGB-D camera, thus allowing to correct any drift between the object and its model on-the-fly.

This paper presents a novel method for autonomous subretinal injection under iOCT guidance that considers tissue deformations during the insertion procedure. The technique is achieved through real-time segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from densely sampled iOCT B-scans, which we refer to as B5-scans. Using B5-scans we monitor the position of the instrument relative to a virtual target layer between the ILM and RPE. Our experiments on ex-vivo porcine eyes demonstrate dynamic adjustment of the insertion depth and overall improved accuracy in needle positioning compared to prior autonomous insertion approaches. Compared to a 35% success rate in subretinal bleb generation with previous approaches, our method reliably created subretinal blebs in 90% our experiments.

Deformable Objects,6-DoF Shape Servoing of Deformable Objects in Co-Rotated Space of Modal Graph,"Yang, Bohan;Huang, Tianyu;Zhong, Fangxun;Liu, Yunhui","Keywords: Visual Servoing, Dexterous Manipulation, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: Shape control of deformable objects under both rotational and translational deformations is important for versatile robotic applications. However, deformation control with full 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulation is an open problem, since modeling and describing rotational deformations lead to significant challenges. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a novel method by introducing a co-rotated space for the modal graph representation of objects with unknown physical and geometric models. In this space, we design new deformation features that can encode local rotations while preserving a compact and low-frequency shape representation. Moreover, these features can be mapped analytically to the robot manipulation, enabling the design of adaptive control laws with guaranteed stability for unmodeled objects. Experiments on complex volumetric objects demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method with raw, noisy, and unregistered point clouds. The results highlight the importance of integrating the co-rotated features to address rotational deformations.",,,,,,
Deformable Objects,Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes,"Shan, Jiwei;Cai, Zeyu;Hsieh, Cheng-Tai;Han, Lijun;Cheng, Shing Shin;Wang, Hesheng","Keywords: Computer Vision for Medical Robotics, Surgical Robotics: Laparoscopy","Abstract: Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments on public datasets captured with static endoscopes demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.",,,,,,
Deformable Objects,One-Shot Video Imitation Via Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs,"Wang, Jianren;Liu, Kangni;Guo, Dingkun;Xian, Zhou;Atkeson, Christopher","Keywords: Learning from Demonstration, Simulation and Animation","Abstract: Learning to manipulate dynamic and deformable objects from a single demonstration video holds great promise in terms of scalability. Previous approaches have predominantly focused on either replaying object relationships or actor trajectories. The former often struggles to generalize across diverse tasks, while the latter suffers from data inefficiency. Moreover, both methodologies encounter challenges in capturing invisible physical attributes, such as forces. In this paper, we propose to interpret video demonstrations through a series of Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs (PSAGs), where nodes represent objects and edges denote relationships between objects. We further ground geometric constraints through simulation to estimate non-geometric, visually imperceptible attributes. The augmented PSAGs are then applied in real robot experiments. Our approach has been validated across a range of tasks, such as Cutting Avocado, Cutting Vegetable, Pouring Liquid, Rolling Dough, and Slicing Pizza. We demonstrate successful generalization to novel objects with distinct visual and physical properties. For visualizations of the learned policies please check: https://jianrenw.com/PSAG/",,,,,,
Deformable Objects,KUDA: Keypoints to Unify Dynamics Learning and Visual Prompting for Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation,"Liu, Zixian;Zhang, Mingtong;Li, Yunzhu","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Model Learning for Control, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), significant progress has been made in developing open-vocabulary robotic manipulation systems. However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a textit{keypoint-based target specification} is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Deformable Objects,DLO Perceiver: Grounding Large Language Model for Deformable Linear Objects Perception,"Caporali, Alessio;Galassi, Kevin;Palli, Gianluca","Keywords: Computer Vision for Manufacturing, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Recognition","Abstract: The perception of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is a challenging task due to their complex and ambiguous appearance, lack of discernible features, typically small sizes, and deformability. Despite these challenges, achieving a robust and effective segmentation of DLOs is crucial to introduce robots into environments where they are currently underrepresented, such as domestic and complex industrial settings. In this context, the integration of language-based inputs can simplify the perception task while also enabling the possibility of introducing robots as human companions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture for the perception of DLOs, wherein the input image is augmented with a text-based prompt guiding the segmentation of the target DLO. After encoding the image and text separately, a Perceiver-inspired structure is exploited to compress the concatenated data into transformer layers and generate the output mask from a latent vector representation. The method is experimentally evaluated on real-world images of DLOs like electrical cables and ropes, validating its efficacy and efficiency in real practical scenarios.",,,,,,
Large Models for Autonomous Vehicles,"Label Anything: An Interpretable, High-Fidelity and Prompt-Free Annotator","Kou, Wei-Bin;Zhu, Guangxu;Ye, Rongguang;Wang, Shuai;Tang, Ming;Wu, Yik-Chung","Keywords: Semantic Scene Understanding, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Intelligent Transportation Systems","Abstract: Learning-based street scene semantic understanding in autonomous driving (AD) has advanced significantly recently, but the performance of the AD model is heavily dependent on the quantity and quality of the annotated training data. However, traditional manual labeling involves high cost to annotate the vast amount of required data for training robust model. To mitigate this cost of manual labeling, we propose a Label Anything Model (denoted as LAM), serving as an interpretable, high-fidelity, and prompt-free data annotator. Specifically, we firstly incorporate a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the latent features. On top of ViT, we propose a semantic class adapter (SCA) and an optimization-oriented unrolling algorithm (OptOU), both with a quite small number of trainable parameters. SCA is proposed to fuse ViT-extracted features to consolidate the basis of the subsequent automatic annotation. OptOU consists of multiple cascading layers and each layer contains an optimization formulation to align its output with the ground truth as closely as possible, though which OptOU acts as being interpretable rather than learning-based blackbox nature. In addition, training SCA and OptOU requires only a single pre-annotated RGB seed image, owing to their small volume of learnable parameters. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed LAM can generate high-fidelity annotations (almost 100% in mIoU) for multiple real-world datasets (i.e., Camvid, Cityscapes, and Apolloscapes) and CARLA simulation dataset.",,,,,,

However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 50% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Imran2205/LogicRAG.",,,,,,

We discretize these styles with quantization, and the styles are used to learn a conditional diffusion policy for simulating human drivers. Our empirical evaluation confirms that the behaviors generated by our approach are both safer and more human-like than those of the machine-learning-based baseline methods.

However, owing to the complexity of AV behavior and the high dimensionality of driving environments, the objective and practical quantitative evaluation of AV intelligence remains a significant and unresolved challenge. This paper proposes a robust training-based comprehensive evaluation (RTCE) system specifically designed to assess the intelligence of AVs in the time dimension. Beginning with a foundation model, the first generation of AVs is developed by training in the initial naturalistic traffic scenarios. To effectively test the intelligence of the AVs, we propose an adversarial trajectory optimization technique to generate challenging, critical test scenarios that evaluate the learning capabilities of AVs in complex environments. Through robust training in these complex scenarios, the second generation of AVs is obtained. To objectively and effectively quantify the intelligence of AVs, we further propose a comprehensive evaluation metric system encompassing five dimensions and 14 evaluation metrics. The intelligence score of each AV is computed using the objective multi-criteria decision-making approach. The proposed intelligence evaluation method is validated using various self-evolution autonomous driving algorithms. The results demonstrate that the RTCE method can quantitatively and effectively test the intelligence of AVs in a multi-dimensional and automated manner. Furthermore, the proposed method is flexible and generalizable, making it adaptable to different testing platforms and autonomous driving algorithms.",,,,,,

In this work, we introduce NaVid-4D, a Vision Language Model (VLM) based navigation agent taking the lead in explicitly showcasing the capabilities of spatial intelligence in the real world. Given natural language instructions, NaVid-4D requires only egocentric RGB-D video streams as observations to perform spatial understanding and reasoning for generating precise instruction-following robotic actions. NaVid-4D learns navigation policies using the data from simulation environments and is endowed with precise spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using web data. Without the need to pre-train an RGB-D foundation model, we propose a method capable of directly injecting the depth features into the visual encoder of a VLM. We further compare the use of factually captured depth information with the monocularly estimated one and find NaVid-4D works well with both while using estimated depth offers greater generalization capability and better mitigates the sim-to-real gap.

Large Models for Autonomous Vehicles,Generating Out-Of-Distribution Scenarios Using Language Models,"Aasi, Erfan;Nguyen, Phat;Sreeram, Shiva;Rosman, Guy;Karaman, Sertac;Rus, Daniela",Keywords: AI-Based Methods,"Abstract: The deployment of autonomous vehicles controlled by machine learning techniques requires extensive testing in diverse real-world environments, robust handling of edge cases and out-of-distribution scenarios, and comprehensive safety validation to ensure that these systems can navigate safely and effectively under unpredictable conditions. Addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) driving scenarios is essential for enhancing safety, as OOD scenarios help validate the reliability of the models within the vehicleÂ’s autonomy stack. However, generating OOD scenarios is challenging due to their long-tailed distribution and rarity in urban driving datasets. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in autonomous driving, particularly for their zero-shot generalization and common-sense reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we leverage these LLM strengths to introduce a framework for generating diverse OOD driving scenarios. Our approach uses LLMs to construct a branching tree, where each branch represents a unique OOD scenario. These scenarios are then simulated in the CARLA simulator using an automated framework that aligns scene augmentation with the corresponding textual descriptions. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations, and assess its performance via a diversity metric that measures the richness of the scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new ""OOD-ness"" metric, which quantifies how much the generated scenarios deviate from typical urban driving conditions. Furthermore, we explore the capacity of modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and safely navigate through the simulated OOD scenarios. Our findings offer valuable insights into the reliability of language models in addressing OOD scenarios within the context of urban driving.",,,,,,

Pedestrians are particularly vulnerable in urban environments, and robust tracking methodologies are required to understand their movements. Prevalent Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) frameworks often underutilize the rich visual data from sensors such as cameras. This study leverages the advanced visual foundation model, DINOv2, to refine the TBD framework by incorporating camera modality, thereby improving pedestrian tracking consistency and overall 3D-MOT performance. The proposed DINO-MOT framework is the first application of DINOv2 for enhancing 3D-MOT through pedestrian Re-Identification (Re-ID), and Score Filter Ceiling is implemented to prevent premature exclusion of low-confidence 3D detections during tracking association.

Steerable needles are typically deployed into tissue from an insertion surface, and selecting the insertion site is critical for procedure success as it determines which paths the needle can take to its target. Prior motion planners for steerable needles typically only plan from a specific start pose to the target. We introduce a new resolution-optimal steerable needle motion planner that efficiently finds plans from an insertion surface to a target position, handling additional degrees of freedom at both the start and the target. Our algorithm systematically builds a search tree consisting of needle motion primitives backward from the target towards the insertion surface, which allows it to provide an optimality guarantee up to the resolution of the primitives. The algorithm finds higher-quality plans faster than prior state-of-the-art motion planners, as demonstrated in anatomical scenario simulations in the lung.",,,,,,

This work proposes a novel self-sufficient method for discrete (one-time) global localization of an MAE based solely on inherent endoscopic images without any prior MAE pose information. More specifically, it adopts a model-free control approach to determine five different external magnet (EM) poses (corresponding to five independent nonlinear equations) that can align the MAE image center with the lumen center while the MAE maintains the same pose. The five degree-of freedom (DoF) global pose of the MAE can then be estimated by minimizing the root mean square of MAE's torque balance residuals under these EM poses. Our proposed method achieves similar accuracy as other sensor-based methods for permanent magnet-driven MAE with 6.7 Â± 2.1 mm position error and 9.5 Â± 2.9Â° orientation error in the experiments.

Control methods to date have primarily focused on controlling the robot tip. However, small changes in the tip position can result in large deviations in the shape of the robot body, motivating the need for shape control to ensure safe navigation in constrained environments. One proposed method for shape control, known as follow-the-leader (FTL) motion, allows the robot to deploy while occupying minimal volume but is limited to specific CTR designs and deployment sequences. In this paper, we propose a shape control method that approximates FTL motion and is applicable to arbitrary tip navigation tasks without requiring a predefined trajectory or specific tube design. This shape control method is framed as a nonlinear optimization problem, and through linearization of the CTR's kinematics, we turn it into a quadratic program solved by a shape controller that requires minimal knowledge of the robot's shape. Simulation results show that our proposed shape control method enables better approximate FTL motion compared to a state-of-the-art Jacobian-based tip controller across different tube sets and tip paths while remaining computationally comparable. Furthermore, a hardware demonstration validates the effectiveness of the shape controller on a physical system during teleoperation.",,,,,,

However, navigating tortuous lung anatomy to the distal branches of the bronchoalveolar tree for adequate sampling using BAL remains challenging. Continuum robots have been used to improve the navigation of guidewires, catheters, and endoscopes and could be applied to the BAL procedure as well. One class of continuum robots is constructed from a notched tube and actuated using a tendon. Many tendon-driven notched continuum robots use uniform machining parameters to achieve approximately constant-curvature configurations, which may be unsuitable for traversing the tortuous anatomy of the lungs.

Logistics and Task Planning,Multi-Heuristic Robotic Bin Packing of Regular and Irregular Objects,"Nickel, Tim;Bormann, Richard;Arras, Kai Oliver","Keywords: Logistics, Manipulation Planning, Factory Automation","Abstract: The increasing demand in e-commerce, combined with labor shortages and rising wages, is driving the rapid automation of warehouse operations. A critical aspect of this shift is bin packing, where diverse unknown items of varying sizes and shapes must be optimally arranged within a bin or container. Robot bin packing is receiving growing attention and presents unique challenges due to the broad range of objects, packing rules, and task-specific requirements. In response, we propose So-Pack, a generalist packing heuristic for irregularly shaped objects integrated into a flexible, weighted multi-heuristic planning system. The system demonstrates robust performance across general packing scenarios and exhibits the flexibility to adapt to changing packing rules and specific end-user requirements. Experimental results show that the system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in key metrics in a new challenging dataset of retail objects in real-world applications.",,,,,,

However, issues such as hallucinations, ambiguities in human instructions, environmental constraints, and limitations in the executing agentÂ’s capabilities often lead to flawed or incomplete plans. This paper proposes MultiTalk, an LLM-based task planning methodology that addresses these issues through a framework of introspective and extrospective dialogue loops. This approach helps ground generated plans in the context of the environment and the agent's capabilities, while also resolving uncertainties and ambiguities in the given task. These loops are enabled by specialized systems designed to extract and predict task-specific states, and flag mismatches or misalignments among the human user, the LLM agent, and the environment. Effective feedback pathways between these systems and the LLM planner foster meaningful dialogue. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through its application to robotic manipulation tasks. Experiments and ablations highlight the robustness and reliability of our method, and comparisons with baselines further illustrate the superiority of MultiTalk in task planning for embodied agents.

Logistics and Task Planning,Goal-Guided Reinforcement Learning: Leveraging Large Language Models for Long-Horizon Task Decomposition,"Zhang, Ceng;Sun, Zhanhong;Chirikjian, Gregory","Keywords: Task Planning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has long struggled with exploration in vast state-action spaces, particularly for intricate tasks that necessitate a series of well-coordinated actions. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) equipped with fundamental knowledge have been utilized for task planning across various domains. However, using them to plan for long-term objectives can be demanding, as they function independently from task environments where their knowledge might not be perfectly aligned, hence often overlooking possible physical limitations. To this end, we propose a goal-based RL framework that leverages prior knowledge of LLMs to benefit the training process. We introduce a hierarchical module that features a goal generator to segment a long-horizon task into reachable subgoals and a policy planner to generate action sequences based on the current goal. Subsequently, the policies derived from LLMs guide the RL to achieve each subgoal sequentially. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across different simulation environments and long-horizon tasks with complex state and action spaces.",,,,,,

The mainstream practice of BT design paradigm has been utilizing the BT component framework to develop task-specific BT structures manually. In contrast, the latest advances in Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) have also opened up the possibility of BT design automation. However, these approaches generally show low efficiency or are less trustworthy for complex robot task goals due to time-consuming manual design and unreliable GPT reasoning. To solve the above limitations, this paper proposes a novel knowledge-driven approach that develops a specialized knowledge graph from multi-sourced and heterogeneous high-quality robot knowledge to reason out a trustworthy robot plan for achieving complex task goals.

Planning Around People for Social Navigation,SafePCA: Enhancing Autonomous Robot Navigation in Dynamic Crowds Using Proximal Policy Optimization and Cellular Automata,"Farouq, Ardiansyah;Tran, Dinh Tuan;Lee, Joo-Ho","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Localization","Abstract: Navigating robots in dynamic environments, such as human crowds, is a major challenge due to the trade-off between performance and robustness. Traditional reinforcement learning methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), have shown strong adaptation capabilities but require extensive training and lack explicit mechanisms for collision avoidance. On the other hand, rule-based approaches, such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), offer computational efficiency but struggle with generalization to unseen crowd behaviors. The proposed SafePCA framework aims to address this trade-off by integrating Cellular Automata (CA) into PPO-based navigation. CA enhances robustness by predicting high-risk areas based on pedestrian movement patterns, reducing unnecessary collisions. However, this approach may lead to conservative behavior, potentially affecting navigation performance in reaching the goal efficiently. The core research question addressed in this work is whether SafePCA can balance these trade-offs to ensure safe yet efficient robot navigation in dynamic crowds. Experiments demonstrate that SafePCA outperforms traditional PPO by providing superior risk assessment and avoidance strategies, achieving optimal performance with fewer training episodes. SafePCAÂ’s real-time adaptability ensures robust navigation in dynamic environments. By leveraging PPOÂ’s adaptive learning and CAÂ’s risk analysis, SafePCA offers an efficient solution for autonomous robot navigation in crowded environments, advancing the field and broadening application possibilities.",,,,,,

Recently, diffusion models have been applied to implement multimodal trajectory prediction. Existing approaches typically employ a standard diffusion process, denoising from a sample drawn from a Gaussian distribution. However, we identify that most agents exhibit an obvious movement trend, rendering many initial denoising steps redundantÂ—primarily transitioning from pure noise to an initial coarse trajectory. To conquer this challenge, this paper innovatively proposes a diffusion refiner that can be used along with existing multi-agent trajectory prediction models to improve their performance. Specifically, we first leverage a baseline model for predicting the coarse future trajectory. Then, the diffusion model is applied as a refiner to reduce the prediction error. Moreover, our method is naturally plug-and-play, allowing convenient integration with existing models. To achieve this, we improve the traditional diffusion process to not only converge towards noise but also the coarse predictions from the baseline model. In such a case, standard step-skipping sampling techniques is inapplicable and we further propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based fast sampling method. Extensive experiments with selected baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,,,

Simulating such safety-critical scenarios is nontrivial, however, from log data that are typically regular scenarios, especially in consideration of dynamic adversarial interactions between the future motions of autonomous vehicles and surrounding traffic participants. To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and efficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving intentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and efficient safety-critical simulation. We formulate the adversarial transfer of driving intention as an optimization problem, facilitating extensive exploration of diverse attack behaviors and efficient solution convergence. Simultaneously, intention-conditioned motion planning benefits from powerful deep models and large-scale real-world data, permitting the simulation of realistic motion behaviors for actors. Specially, through adapting driving intentions based on environments, IntSim facilitates the flexible realization of dynamic adversarial interactions with autonomous vehicles.

Existing task planners often operate myopically, focusing solely on immediate goals without considering the impact of current actions on future tasks. Anticipatory planning, which reduces the joint objective of the immediate planning cost of the current task and the expected cost associated with future subsequent tasks, offers an approach for improving long-lived task planning.

It is expected that Diffusion Policy possesses scalability, a key attribute for deep neural networks, typically suggesting that increasing model size would lead to enhanced performance. However, our observations indicate that Diffusion Policy in transformer architecture (DP) struggles to scale effectively; even minor additions of layers can deteriorate training outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce Scalable Diffusion Transformer Policy for visuomotor learning. Our proposed method, namely textbf{methodname}, introduces two modules that improve the training dynamic of Diffusion Policy and allow the network to better handle multimodal action distribution. First, we identify that DP~suffers from large gradient issues, making the optimization of Diffusion Policy unstable. To resolve this issue, we factorize the feature embedding of observation into multiple affine layers, and integrate it into the transformer blocks. Additionally, our unmasking strategy allows the policy network to enquote{see} future actions during prediction, helping to reduce compounding errors. We demonstrate that our proposed method successfully scales the Diffusion Policy from 10 million to 1 billion parameters.

OccRWKV separates semantics, occupancy prediction, and feature fusion into distinct branches, each incorporating Sem-RWKV and Geo-RWKV blocks. These blocks are designed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the network to learn domain-specific representation (i.e., semantics and geometry), which enhances prediction accuracy. Leveraging the sparse nature of real-world 3D occupancy, we reduce computational overhead by projecting features into the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and propose a BEV-RWKV block for efficient feature enhancement and fusion. This enables real-time inference at 22.2 FPS without compromising performance. Experiments demonstrate that OccRWKV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving a mIoU of 25.1 while being 20 times faster than the best baseline, Co-Occ, making it suitable for real-time deployment on robots to enhance autonomous navigation efficiency.

Monocular depth estimation models trained on single images achieve impressive results on individual frames but often lack temporal consistency when applied to videos, leading to flickering and artifacts. Current video depth estimation methods often rely on additional optical flow or camera poses, which are limited by their accuracy, carefullydesigned, and lack robustness. Specially, we propose a plug-and-play method that seamlessly transfers the robustness of image depth estimation to video depth estimation. By leveraging powerful priors from image depth estimation, our method enhances the performance of video depth estimation without requiring additional conditional inputs or extensive pretraining on large and expensive video datasets. We introduce the Temporal Depth Stabilization Module (TDSM), which can seamlessly inflate an image monocular depth estimation model into a video depth estimation model, enabling unified modeling of depth across video sequences and capturing the temporal cues in video. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method across various datasets (e.g., normal and challenging conditions) and different backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple and effective method significantly improves monocular depth estimation networks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in both spatial and temporal dimensions.",,,,,,

Tailored for settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned dynamics model.

In this work, we propose a new approach for modeling these environments by learning a quasi-static contact force model instead of a full simulator. Using a feature vector that contains information about the configuration and control, we find a linear mapping adequately captures the relationship between this feature vector and the sensed contact forces. A novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm is used to solve for the globally optimal mapping in real time without any matrix inversions, resulting in an algorithm that runs in nearly constant time on a GPU as the model size increases. We validate the proposed approach for connector insertion in both simulation and hardware experiments, where the learned model is combined with an optimization-based impedance controller to achieve smooth insertions in the presence of misalignments and uncertainty.

It is known that in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced by the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine learning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these effects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the resulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles counterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits of first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an accurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects resulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within our model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control design.

One of the critical challenge in autonomous driving is the complexity of vehicle dynamics, which impedes the formulation of accurate vehicle model. Inaccurate vehicle model can significantly impact the performance of MPC controller. To address this issue, this paper decomposes the nominal vehicle model into invariable and variable elements. The accuracy of invariable elements are ensured by calibration, while the deviations in the variable elements are learned by a low-dimensional residual model. The features of residual model are selected as the physical variables most correlated with nominal model errors. Physical constraints among these features are formulated to explicitly define the valid region within the feature space. The formulated model and constraints are incorporated into the MPC framework and validated through both simulation and real vehicle experiments.

Since simple feedback control is infeasible, model-based control offers potential to account for the non-linear effects, but requires computation efficient and accurate models. Promising results have been achieved utilizing data-driven models that introduce a latent kinematic chain as model of the DLO and mapping measurements of the tip position in its latent joint space, in which the dynamic motion model is learned. So far, this approach has the limitation that it can not handle situations of incomplete sensory information, for instance if occlusion occurs. Consequently, this paper introduces a fusion network architecture capable of making predictions even if sensory information is incomplete. We achieve additional state estimation of the latent joint state by learning a data driven inverse kinematics with help of wrench measurements at the DLO base and evaluate our approach by simulating occlusion.

However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-corrective planning of tasks with inverse prompting, named InversePrompt, which contains reasoning steps to provide interpretable groundings for feedback. It generates the inverse actions corresponding to generated actions and verifies if these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, thereby explicitly validating the logical flow of the generated plans. The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods.

Point Cloud Registration,SANDRO: A Robust Solver with a Splitting Strategy for Point Cloud Registration,"Adlerstein, Michael;Soares, JoÃ£o Carlos Virgolino;Bratta, Angelo;Semini, Claudio","Keywords: RGB-D Perception, Mapping","Abstract: Point cloud registration is a critical problem in computer vision and robotics, especially in the field of navigation. Current methods often fail when faced with high outlier rates or take a long time to converge to a suitable solution. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for point cloud registration called SANDRO (Splitting strategy for point cloud Alignment using Non-convex anD Robust Optimization), which combines an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) framework with a robust loss function with graduated non-convexity. This approach is further enhanced by a splitting strategy designed to handle high outlier rates and skewed distributions of outliers. SANDRO is capable of addressing important limitations of existing methods, as in challenging scenarios where the presence of high outlier rates and point cloud symmetries significantly hinder convergence. SANDRO achieves superior performance in terms of success rate when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a 20% improvement from the current state of the art when tested on the Redwood real dataset and 60% improvement when tested on synthetic data.",,,,,,
Point Cloud Registration,Bridging In-Situ and Satellite Data: Enhancing Gas Concentration Estimation through Integration of Data-Driven and Physics-Based Modeling,"Lu, Guoyu","Keywords: RGB-D Perception, Vision-Based Navigation, Visual Tracking","Abstract: Gas concentration estimation is crucial for understanding and mitigating climate change. While most research and monitoring efforts focus on major greenhouse gases such as CO2, significantly less attention has been given to trace gases like NO2, which play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and air quality. This paper aims to enhance trace gas concentration estimation by integrating physics-based models into data-driven neural network frameworks. Furthermore, to improve large-scale estimation accuracy, we incorporate in-situ measurements to refine neural network models trained on satellite observations. The resulting model can provide reliable large-scale gas concentration estimates, particularly for locations lacking precise in-situ measurements. This approach offers a novel pathway to enhance the accuracy and applicability of gas monitoring for climate and environmental research. While NO2 serves as the target trace gas in this study, the proposed framework is potentially applicable to the prediction of other atmospheric gas concentrations.",,,,,,
Image and 3D Segmentation 1,A Novel Decomposed Feature-Oriented Framework for Open-Set Semantic Segmentation on LiDAR Data,"Deng, Wenbang;Chen, Xieyuanli;Yu, Qinghua;He, Yunze;Xiao, Junhao;Lu, Huimin","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Computer Vision for Automation, Computer Vision for Transportation","Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a key technique that enables mobile robots to understand and navigate surrounding environments autonomously. However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Image and 3D Segmentation 1,SAM-Guided Pseudo Label Enhancement for Multi-Modal 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Yang, Mingyu;Lu, Jitong;Kim, Hun-Seok","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Sensor Fusion","Abstract: Multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation is vital for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR). To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.",,,,,,

Then, we deploy the model in an eye-in-hand visual servoing system to enact robot control in the real world. The key to our system is the representation of salient visual information as geometric constraints, linking the robotÂ’s visual perception to actionable commands.

In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.",,,,,,

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has excelled in static image segmentation, extending its capabilities to video segmentation poses significant challenges. We tackle two major hurdles: a) SAMÂ’s embedding limitations in associating objects across frames, and b) granularity inconsistencies in object segmentation. To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking.

However, accurately segmenting and estimating the depth of transparent objects remain challenging due to complex optical properties. Existing methods primarily delve into only one task using extra inputs or specialized sensors, neglecting the valuable interactions among tasks and the subsequent refinement process, leading to suboptimal and blurry predictions. To address these issues, we propose a monocular framework, which is the first to excel in both segmentation and depth estimation of transparent objects, with only a single-image input. Specifically, we devise a novel semantic and geometric fusion module, effectively integrating the multi-scale information between tasks.

Unlike traditional methods which often consider these rocks and boulders as obstacles and attempt to find a clear path to circumvent them, in this study we aim to develop methods for robots to actively utilize interaction forces with these ""obstacles"" for locomotion and navigation. To do so, we studied the locomotion of a quadrupedal robot as it traversed a simplified obstacle field, and discovered that with different gaits, the robot could passively converge to distinct orientations. A compositional return map explained this observed passive convergence, and enabled theoretical prediction of the steady-state orientation angles for any given quadrupedal gait. We experimentally demonstrated that with these predictions, a legged robot could effectively generate desired shape of trajectories amongst large, slippery obstacles, simply by switching between different gaits.

The RL-ATR features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the RL-ATR.

PASIST autonomously explores and selects high-quality trajectories based on predefined target poses instead of demonstrations, leveraging the Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL) framework. To further enhance learning, We develop a skill selection module to mitigate mode collapse by balancing the weights of skills with varying levels of difficulty.

However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise.

Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the armÂ’s workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains.

A major challenge in achieving this is the inherent imbalance caused by the sparsity of error-related potential (ErrP) events in streaming electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which often leads models to learn irrelevant features and perform poorly. Thus, while Deep learning-based ErrP detection has seen considerable advancements, the variability in individual user reaction times introduces labelling errors, complicating model adaptation to new subjects. Moreover, most deep learning methods are developed and validated on discrete, offline experiments using pre-defined windows, which fail to translate effectively to continuous, real-time HRI. Addressing these challenges is crucial to improving the robustness and adaptability of real-time ErrP detection in practical HRI applications. Here, we develop a causal EEG conformer framework, combining a Convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a transformer with causal attention for real-time prediction of ErrP signals during HRI.

The problem is exacerbated for small AUVs for which the dynamics can change significantly with payload changes and deployments under different hydrodynamic conditions. The common approach to AUV control is a combination of passive stabilization with added buoyancy on top and weights on the bottom, and a PID controller tuned for simple and smooth motion primitives. However, the approach comes at the cost of sluggish controls and often the need to re-tune controllers with configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a fast (trainable in minutes), reinforcement learning-based approach for full 6 degree of freedom (DOF) control of a thruster-driven AUVs, taking 6-DOF command-conditioned inputs direct to thruster outputs. We present a new, highly parallelized simulator for underwater vehicle dynamics.

Aerial Robots: Learning 1,Learning Local Urban Wind Flow Fields from Range Sensing,"Folk, Spencer;Melton, John;Margolis, Benjamin W. L.;Yim, Mark;Kumar, Vijay","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Perception and Autonomy, Deep Learning Methods, Automation Technologies for Smart Cities","Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely predictions of the wind through an urban environment is a challenging task, but has wide-ranging implications for the safety and efficiency of autonomous aerial vehicles in future urban airspaces. Prior work relies strongly on global information about the environment, such as a precise map of the city and in-situ wind measurements at various locations, to run expensive computational fluid dynamics solvers to predict the entire wind flow field. In contrast, this paper introduces a new method to estimate the wind flow field in a region around the robot in real time, utilizing on-board range measurements to sense nearby buildings and sparse wind measurements to infer windspeed and direction. We propose that this information sufficiently characterizes the structure of the wind flow field in the local region of interest. To that end, we introduce a deep learning-based approach to predict local flow fields from range measurements. Our results indicate that a neural network trained on numerous simulated winds through small randomized maps is capable of reconstructing local wind flows while generalizing to larger environments with over 200 buildings. This contribution empowers computationally-constrained aerial robots to reason about the structure of local wind flow fields, thereby enabling new planning, control, and estimation strategies in windy urban environments without textit{a priori} knowledge of the map.",,,,,,
Aerial Robots: Learning 1,Whole-Body Control through Narrow Gaps from Pixels to Action,"Wu, Tianyue;Chen, Yeke;Chen, Tianyang;Zhao, Guangyu;Gao, Fei","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Sensorimotor Learning, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Flying through body-size narrow gaps in the environment is one of the most challenging moments for an underactuated multirotor. We explore a purely data-driven method to master this flight skill in simulation, where a neural network directly maps pixels and proprioception to continuous low-level control commands. This learned policy enables whole-body control through gaps with different geometries demanding sharp attitude changes (e.g., near-vertical roll angle). The policy is achieved by successive model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and online observation space distillation. The RL policy receives (virtual) point clouds of the gaps' edges for scalable simulation and is then distilled into the high-dimensional pixel space. However, this flight skill is fundamentally expensive to learn by exploring in RL due to restricted feasible solution space. We propose to reset the agent as states on the trajectories by a model-based trajectory optimizer to alleviate this problem. The presented training pipeline is compared with baseline methods, and ablation studies are conducted to identify the key ingredients of the method. The immediate next step is to scale up the variation of gap sizes and geometries in anticipation of emergent policies and demonstrate the sim-to-real transformation.",,,,,,

Aerial Robots: Learning 1,Environment As Policy: Learning to Race in Unseen Tracks,"Wang, Hongze;Xing, Jiaxu;Messikommer, Nico;Scaramuzza, Davide","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Perception and Autonomy, Reinforcement Learning, AI-Enabled Robotics","Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved outstanding success in complex robot control tasks, such as drone racing, where the RL agents have outperformed human champions in a known racing track. However, these agents fail in unseen track configurations, always requiring complete retraining when presented with new track layouts. This work aims to develop RL agents that generalize effectively to novel track configurations without retraining. The naive solution of training directly on a diverse set of track layouts can overburden the agent, resulting in suboptimal policy learning as the increased complexity of the environment impairs the agentÂ’s ability to learn to fly. To enhance the generalizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping framework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the agentÂ’s performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to design environments that strike a balance between being challenging and achievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively. Using our adaptive environment shaping, one single racing policy efficiently learns to race in diverse and challenging tracks. Experimental results validated in both simulation and the real world show that our method enables drones to successfully fly complex and unseen race tracks, outperforming existing environment-shaping techniques.",,,,,,

Accurately predicting terrain characteristics allows optimizing a vehicle's path against potential hazards. Recent methods use deep neural networks to predict traversability-related terrain properties in a self-supervised manner, relying on proprioception as a training signal. However, onboard cameras are inherently limited by their point-of-view relative to the ground, suffering from occlusions and vanishing pixel density with distance. This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised terrain characterization using an aerial perspective from a hovering drone. We capture terrain-aligned images while sampling the environment with a ground vehicle, effectively training a simple predictor for vibrations, bumpiness, and energy consumption. Our dataset includes 2.8 km of off-road data collected in forest environment, comprising 13 484 ground-based images and 12 935 aerial images. Our findings show that drone imagery improves terrain property prediction by 21.37 % on the whole dataset and 37.35 % in high vegetation, compared to ground images. We conduct ablation studies to identify the main causes of these performance improvements. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach by scouting an unseen area with a drone, planning and executing an optimized path on the ground.",,,,,,

Multi-Robot Formation Control,GMF: Gravitational Mass-Force Framework for Parametric Multi-Level Coordination in Multi-Robot and Swarm Robotic Systems,"Starks, Michael;Parasuraman, Ramviyas","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Swarm Robotics, Cooperating Robots","Abstract: Distributed multi-robot coordination is critical to achieving reliable robotic missions that exploit the collective capability of swarm robots. In particular, the consensus and formation control problems have been extensively studied, resulting in distributed controllers that enable robots to rely only on information from themselves and their immediate neighbors. However, these algorithms are usually designed for specific objectives (e.g., cooperative object transportation, environmental coverage, etc.), requiring the controllers to be re-designed for domain variations. Therefore, we propose a new parametric framework inspired by gravitational fields that allow simultaneous coordination of robots at multiple levels, enabling generalization and domain adaptation. Our approach is built on top of a connectivity-preserving formation controller, with need-based and task-based ad hoc coordination at private, local, and global layers of a swarm robot team. We demonstrate the remarkable potential of our framework through extensive simulations and real-world swarm robot experiments in three representative multi-robot tasks involving tight coordination: 1) robot-initiated rendezvous at different coordination layers, 2) coordinated boundary tracking and coverage of environmental processes, and 3) accommodating task executions and motion control while satisfying the coordination laws.",,,,,,

We consider directed communications and constant input disturbances rejection in the controller design. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves the asymptotic stability of the proposed controller. The convergence of the orientations of agents to some constant values is also guaranteed. The method has the potential to be extended to deal with various real-world applications, such as object enclosing.

Specifically, we decompose the robots' maneuvers into two independent components, i.e., interception and enclosing, which are parameterized by two independent virtual coordinates. Treating these two virtual coordinates as dimensions of an abstract manifold, we derive the corresponding singularity-free guiding vector field (GVF), which, along with a distributed coordination mechanism based on the consensus theory, guides robots to achieve various motions (i.e., versatile maneuvering), including (a) formation tracking, (b) target enclosing, and (c) circumnavigation. Additional motion parameters can generate more complex cooperative robot motions. Based on GVFs, we design a controller for a nonholonomic robot model.

Robot teams often need to maintain specific formations, such as wedge formations, to enhance visibility, positioning, and efficiency during fast movement. However, complex environments such as narrow corridors challenge rigid team formations, which makes effective formation control difficult in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Adaptive Formation with Oscillation Reduction (AFOR) approach to improve coordinated multi-robot navigation. We develop AFOR under the theoretical framework of hierarchical learning and integrate a spring-damper model with hierarchical learning to enable both team coordination and individual robot control. At the upper level, a graph neural network facilitates formation adaptation and information sharing among the robots. At the lower level, reinforcement learning enables each robot to navigate and avoid obstacles while maintaining the formations. We conducted extensive experiments using Gazebo in the Robot Operating System (ROS), a high-fidelity Unity3D simulator with ROS, and real robot teams. Results demonstrate that AFOR enables smooth navigation with formation adaptation in complex scenarios and outperforms previous methods.

Multi-Robot Systems 3,Distributed Multi-Robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources,"Chen, Lingpeng;Kailas, Siva;Deolasee, Srujan;Luo, Wenhao;Sycara, Katia;Kim, Woojun","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Systems 3,MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Constrained Field-Of-View Multi-Robot Exploration in Large-Scale Environments,"Chiun, Jimmy;Zhang, Shizhe;Wang, Yizhuo;Cao, Yuhong;Sartoretti, Guillaume Adrien","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVELÂ’s learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVELÂ’s generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Systems 3,RACE: A Fast and Lightweight Urban Exploration and Search Strategy for Multi-Robot Systems,"Leong, Jabez Kit;Soh, Gim Song","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Search and Rescue Robots, Swarm Robotics","Abstract: Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) are increasingly deployed for hazardous tasks in urban environments. Among many tasks, search and rescue remains challenging as it deals with exploration in an unknown indoor constrained environment. For example, without global knowledge of the map of a building floor, it is not advantageous to choose one path over another at a corridor junction. Also, if the assigned frontiers are far from the robot, backtracking along a corridor will cost more than moving forward. Since exploration along corridors is similar to solving a maze, this paper examines classical maze-solving algorithms that are known to be computationally fast and lightweight, such as the Right Hand Rule (RHR), Random Mouse (RM), and more. The authors have identified two gaps that need to be addressed before these algorithms can be applied to physical MRS. Firstly, these algorithms are not designed for the cooperation of multiple agents in exploration. Secondly, they are often applied to only a low-fidelity simulation environment, which requires some work to make these algorithms transferable to work in the commonly used occupancy grid map environment. In this paper, the authors introduced RACE, a fast and lightweight collective urban exploration and search algorithm based on a modified and condensed version of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed solution is successfully verified in a low-fidelity simulation, evaluated against other exploration and search algorithms like RHR and RM. An innovative approach of RACE Simulation to Physical implementation is presented and a physical system evaluation is performed to evaluate RACE against a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree algorithm. Finally, the proposed solution is further verified with a physical experiment, which a quadrupedal robot is assigned to explore part of a floor of SUTD, spanning approximately (55m x 40m). RACE also showed potential in handling challenging close-loop and dead-end environments.",,,,,,

Our approach enables agents to decide their next action using an agent-centered field-of-view occupancy grid, and features extracted from A* algorithm-based trajectories to frontiers in the reconstructed global map. Furthermore, we propose a constrained communication scheme that enables agents to share their environmental knowledge efficiently, minimizing exploration redundancy. The decentralized nature of our framework ensures that each agent operates autonomously, while contributing to a collective exploration mission.

We present an approach for incorporating multi-robot informative path planning into a spatiotemporal adaptive sampling framework while considering path length constraints for sampling location selection. We also incorporate informative path planning to determine the best path to collect samples along while en route to collecting the desired sample. We achieve this in a decentralized manner by decoupling the process into two stages: the first stage uses our spatiotemporal mixture of Gaussian Processes (STMGP) model to determine the most informative sampling location via a mutual information lower bound heuristic and the second stage plans an informative path to collect the desired sample and other additional informative samples via submodular function optimization. Moreover, we effectively leverage peer-to-peer communication to enable coordination.

To address the challenges in mechanically actuated haptic feedback devices such as limited mobility, mechanical wear, and complex mechanical structures, several research sought to develop electromagnetic haptic feedback systems. However, they also suffer from the rapid decay of magnetic force with distance, thus restricting their workspace size and application potential. In this paper, we propose a novel electromagnetic haptic feedback device that is actuated by magnetic torque instead of magnetic force. By controlling the magnetic torque, which decays with distance only at a third-order rate, our device achieves a large workspaceÂ—a 200-mm-diameter hemisphereÂ—while still delivering perceptible real-time haptic feedback within the hemisphere. While using the device, the user wears a lightweight haptic thimble housing a permanent magnet on their finger, which enables 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) haptic feedback.

We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.",,,,,,
Assembly,Assembly Order Planning for Modular Structures by Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems,"Peters, Tom;Cheung, Kenneth C.;Kostitsyna, Irina","Keywords: Assembly, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Parallel Robots","Abstract: Coordinated multi-agent robotic construction provides a means to build infrastructure in extreme environments and improve efficiency in high performance applications. Planning methods are key to understanding and achieving the scope of such applications, and are typically tailored to specific models of construction material and a consideration of passivity or activity thereof. Here, we focus on the NASA Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) model, which includes passive lightweight structural modules and small robots that traverse the structure. We present an algorithm for calculating a build plan for robots under the constraints of this type of system. We then evaluate the quality of this plan experimentally. Many of the techniques we use can be applied to any robotic assembly system whose robots perform locomotion over the structure that they are building.",,,,,,
Assembly,"Master Rules from Chaos: Learning to Reason, Plan, and Interact from Chaos for Tangram Assembly","Zhao, Chao;Jiang, Chunli;Luo, Lifan;Zhang, Guanlan;Yu, Hongyu;Wang, Michael Yu;Chen, Qifeng","Keywords: Grasping, Assembly","Abstract: Tangram assembly, the art of human intelligence and manipulation dexterity, is a new challenge for robotics and reveals the limitations of state-of-the-arts. Here, we describe our initial exploration and highlight key problems in reasoning, planning, and manipulation for robotic tangram assembly. We present MRChaos (Master Rules from Chaos), a robust and general solution for learning assembly policies that can generalize to novel objects. In contrast to conventional methods based on prior geometric and kinematic models, MRChaos learns to assemble randomly generated objects through self-exploration in simulation without prior experience in assembling target objects. The reward signal is obtained from the visual observation change without manually designed models or annotations. MRChaos retains its robustness in assembling various novel tangram objects that have never been encountered during training, with only silhouette prompts. We show the potential of MRChaos in wider applications such as cutlery combinations. The presented work indicates that radical generalization in robotic assembly can be achieved by learning in much simpler domains.",,,,,,

Assembly,Robotic Dry-Stacking of ClochÃ¡in with Irregular Stones,"Liu, Yifang;Napp, Nils","Keywords: Robotics and Automation in Construction, Assembly","Abstract: This paper explores automated robotic construction of clochÃ¡in, a type of corbelled rock shelter, traditionally crafted by skilled workers. While robots have been employed for simple dry-stacking tasks in the past, such as construction of stone walls or vertical stone towers, the question of whether robots possess the capacity to construct more functional structures remains unanswered. This study presents a significant step forward in robotic dry-stacking of functional structures: the assembly of natural stones into freestanding clochÃ¡in structures. We also present a set of stackability measures to aid stone selection, which significantly improves the stability of the planned structures. Our sequential filtering approach, originally designed for planning stone walls, plays a foundational role in achieving stable clochÃ¡n construction. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the stackability measures and demonstrate the physical execution of dry-stacking clochÃ¡in. The progress demonstrated in this paper opens the door to robotic construction of a wide range of utility structures in unstructured environments.",,,,,,

Extending these tasks to continuous robot-object interactions with the surface of complex geometries remains an open problem. In this paper we investigate end-to-end DRL solutions for depowdering tasks that work by directing a pressurized air stream onto the object's surfaces using a blast nozzle head mounted on a robotic arm. We develop a GPU accelerated vectorized cleaning effect for integration into RL training and consider ways to expose vision-less trajectory synthesis for surface treatment applications to the RL agent based on UV mapping. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DRL has the potential to be used for generating object-specific agents for depowdering tasks on a variety of 3D objects without requiring intermediate path planners even in a full 3D motion setup. Finally, we show that DRL-generated trajectories can be transferred to a real-world setup. Our task formulation lends itself to approximate a wide range of surface treatment applications (e.g., cleaning and spray painting) with various effects.",,,,,,
Reinforcement Learning Applications,World Model-Based Perception for Visual Legged Locomotion,"Lai, Hang;Cao, Jiahang;Xu, Jiafeng;Wu, Hongtao;Lin, Yunfeng;Kong, Tao;Yu, Yong;Zhang, Weinan","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Legged Robots","Abstract: Legged locomotion over various terrains is challenging and requires precise perception of the robot and its surroundings from both proprioception and vision. However, learning directly from high-dimensional visual input is often data-inefficient and intricate. To address this issue, traditional methods attempt to learn a teacher policy with access to privileged information first and then learn a student policy to imitate the teacher's behavior with visual input. Despite some progress, this imitation framework prevents the student policy from achieving optimal performance due to the information gap between inputs. Furthermore, the learning process is unnatural since animals intuitively learn to traverse different terrains based on their understanding of the world without privileged knowledge. Inspired by this natural ability, we propose a simple yet effective method, World Model-based Perception (WMP), which builds a world model of the environment and learns a policy based on the world model. We illustrate that though completely trained in simulation, the world model can make accurate predictions of real-world trajectories, thus providing informative signals for the policy controller. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that WMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in traversability and robustness.

Reinforcement Learning Applications,V-Pilot: A Velocity Vector Control Agent for Fixed-Wing UAVs from Imperfect Demonstrations,"Gong, Xudong;Dawei, Feng;Xu, Kele;Zhou, Xing;Zheng, Si;Ding, Bo;Wang, Huaimin","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Learning from Demonstration, Aerial Systems: Applications","Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Velocity Vector Control (VVC) for fixed-wing UAVs using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the presence of imperfect demonstrations. The multi-objective and long-horizon nature of VVC introduces significant spatial and temporal complexities, complicating RL's exploration. While demonstration-based RL methods can help mitigate exploration challenges, their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the provided demonstrations. To tackle this, we propose V-Pilot, a novel approach that integrates: (1) a controller equipped with a control law model to reduce action oscillation, thus alleviating temporal exploration issues, and (2) a VVC-specific training workflow for iterative policy refinement and demonstration quality improvement. This framework is designed to enhance the performance of demonstration-based RL under imperfect demonstrations. We evaluate V-Pilot on the fixed-wing UAV RL environment, FlyCraft.

Reinforcement Learning Applications,Efficiently Generating Expressive Quadruped Behaviors Via Language-Guided Preference Learning,"Clark, Jaden;Hejna, Donald;Sadigh, Dorsa","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Social HRI, Emotional Robotics","Abstract: Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However, determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries, outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional preference learning approaches.

To this end, we propose SchedHGNN, a novel MARL algorithm that incorporates a heterogeneous graph neural network and an intrinsic reward scheme to enhance agent coordination and mitigate challenges induced by environment non-stationarity. Our results show that the combination of effective RAS scheduling and improved communication enables our model to outperform competitive baselines by up to 37.8%.

Exoskeletons,Real-Time Ultrasound Imaging of a Human Muscle to Optimize Shared Control in a Hybrid Exoskeleton,"Iyer, Ashwin;Sun, Ziyue;Lambeth, Krysten;Singh, Mayank;Cleveland, Christine;Sharma, Nitin","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Optimization and Optimal Control, Rehabilitation Robotics, Ultrasound Imaging","Abstract: A hybrid exoskeleton is a class of wearable robotic technology that simultaneously uses a powered exoskeleton and functional electrical stimulation (FES) to generate assistive joint torques for people with impaired mobility due to neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The hybrid assistive technology benefits from FES that actively elicits force from paralyzed muscles via their neural excitation, leading to muscle strengthening. The main technical barrier to realizing the hybrid technology is to attain stable coordination between FES and the exoskeleton despite the quick onset of FES-induced muscle fatigue, which causes a rapid decline in the muscle force. Current methods to measure the induced fatigue lack direct muscle state measurements and may be ineffective at capturing the muscle force decay due to FES. Instead, ultrasound (US) imaging accurately quantifies FES-related muscle contractility and fatigue due to the direct visualization of muscle fibers. In this paper, we use real-time US imaging-derived muscle strain changes as biomarkers of FES-induced fatigue in an optimal controller that modulates exoskeleton assistance and FES dosage. To demonstrate that real-time US imaging is a promising muscle-machine interface technology that can optimize shared control in a hybrid exoskeleton, we perform experiments involving continuous seated knee extension and over-ground walking tasks on two participants with SCI and four participants without disabilities. Furthermore, this work helps design a novel and unprecedented robotic gait technology with the capability to impart FES-associated therapeutic benefits while assisting the gait of neurologically impaired individuals, including those with SCI, stroke, multiple sclerosis, etc.",,,,,,
Exoskeletons,Design and Control of a Novel Semi-Passive Knee Exoskeleton,"Sade, Alon;Coifman, Itay;Riemer, Raziel;Zarrouk, David","Keywords: Mechanism Design, Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Wearable Robotics","Abstract: This paper presents a novel semi-passive knee exoskeleton designed to provide running assistance. It incorporates an energy-efficient clutch mechanism activated by a mini servomotor which engages and disengages the spring that supports the leg during running. The exoskeleton extracts energy during the running phase when the muscles are acting as brakes (negative power), stores it in the spring, and then returns this energy during the positive power phase (when the muscles are acting as motors). The exoskeleton controller implements an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to estimate the shank orientation that determines when to engage and disengage the spring. Two experiments designed to probe the functionality of the exoskeleton were conducted to evaluate its control performance and actuation, and the exoskeleton's biomechanical impact on three subjects. The findings showed that the control mechanism could be engaged and disengaged in real time. The maximum moment created on the knee muscles was 17 Nm, although the device could supply 28 Nm. The ratio of the consumed servo energy consumption to the subjectsÂ’ saved energy was 1:160 (0.1W input to 16W saved). This study thus paves the way for the development of lightweight, inexpensive exoskeletons that can contribute to their greater availability for a broader range of individuals.",,,,,,

The BATE is designed to mimic the self-stress equilibrium and self-supporting characteristics of the human ankle biotensegrity structure. Model-based control strategies are conventional methods that can help discover the principles of complex tensegrity systems. The high dimensions and non-linearity of the BATE pose challenges for physical modelling and require unique model-based control strategies. In this study, we propose a modelling method that considers interaction force and explore the trajectory tracking performance and robustness of the ankle exoskeleton under three power-assisted control methods: position control, force control, and hybrid force-position contorl. The experimental results suggest that the PC method offers superior tracking performance and robustness compared to the other two methods. This method can be used for early rehabilitation training to improve flexibility. The control concept emphasizes its advantages over current wearable exoskeletons and introduces new ideas for high-performance exoskeletons.",,,,,,

Exoskeletons,Human-Like Walking Motion Generation for Self-Balancing Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons,"Yang, Ming;Chen, Ziqiang;Li, Wentao;Li, Feng;Shang, Weiwei;Tian, Dingkui;Wu, Xinyu","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Rehabilitation Robotics, Wearable Robotics","Abstract: Self-balancing lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (SLLREs) allow individuals with lower limb dysfunction to walk without the use of crutches. Stable and human-like walking motions are crucial for SLLREs because achieving a close imitation of healthy human walking is a key goal in rehabilitation therapy. Existing SLLREs can realize stable walking but lack human-like features. This paper designs a walking motion generator based on hierarchical optimization to generate a human-like walking motion with variable hip height, heel-strike, toe-off, and knee-stretched features. This hierarchically optimized human-like walking motion generator consists of a knee-stretched optimizer and an optimization-based stabilizing filter. Specifically, the knee-stretched optimizer realizes the stretched knee feature by optimizing the hip trajectory with varying heights. And the stabilizing filter realizes stable walking by optimizing the hip trajectory in the sagittal plane direction.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed human-like walking motion generator, walking experiments were conducted on SLLRE AutoLEE-G3 both in a simulation environment and the real world. The experimental results show that the human-like walking motions look more natural and reduce the required torque for the knee joint compared with knee-bent walking.",,,,,,
Exoskeletons,Kinematic Benefits of a Cable-Driven Exosuit for Head-Neck Mobility,"Bales, Ian;Zhang, Haohan","Keywords: Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Wearable Robotics, Tendon/Wire Mechanism","Abstract: This letter presents a novel cable-driven exosuit intended for head-neck support and movement assistance. Mobility limitations in the head-neck, such as dropped head syndrome, can result from various neurological disorders. Current solutions, ranging from static neck collars to rigid-link robotic neck exoskeletons, are unsatisfactory. Neck collars are the most used clinically but fail to restore head-neck motion. Rigid-link neck exoskeletons can enable head movement but are bulky and restrictive. In this letter, we present the design of this exosuit, an analysis of its ability to balance the gravitational moment of the head in simulation, and the results of a user study comparing its kinematic performance to a state-of-the-art rigid-link neck exoskeleton. The exosuit is able to support the head across its full range of motion according to simulation results. It fits users of different sizes and participants exhibited more natural head-neck movement wearing the exosuit as compared to wearing the rigid-link exoskeleton. The exosuit allowed more head rotations than the rigid-link neck exoskeleton and required less compensatory torso movement for three daily tasks (looking for traffic, drinking from a bottle, and picking up an object from the floor). Its absolute range of motion was also much larger than the one allowed by the rigid-link neck exoskeleton. These results demonstrate the kinematic benefits of a cable-driven neck exosuit and provide justification for studying the use of such an exosuit for head-neck movement assistance in patient groups.",,,,,,

In this paper, a Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve based Reduced-Order-Model (ROM) relying on the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature is investigated for the modeling and the control of SCM. This allows, first, reducing the dimension of the SCM kinematics based on the PH parametric curves with a predefined length and second, developing the shape kinematics control from its control polygon. The use of the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature allows to move independently the PH curve control points, while preserving PH features of length and minimum curve energy.

However, to do so, they typically require multiple segments, often leading to complex actuation and control challenges. To this end, we propose a novel approach to navigate cluttered spaces effectively for a single-segment long TDCR which is the simplest topology from a mechanical point of view. Our key insight is that by leveraging contact with the environment we can achieve multiple curvatures without mechanical alterations to the robot. Specifically, we propose a search-based motion planner for a single-segment TDCR. This planner, guided by a specially designed heuristic, discretizes the configuration space and employs a best-first search. The heuristic, crucial for efficient navigation, provides an effective cost-to-go estimation while respecting the kinematic constraints of the TDCR and environmental interactions. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of our planner-testing over 525 queries in environments with both convex and non-convex obstacles, our planner is demonstrated to have a success rate of about 80% while baselines were not able to obtain a success rate higher than 30%. The difference is attributed to our novel heuristic which is shown to significantly reduce the required search space.",,,,,,

Current models either oversimplify the dynamics by assuming quasi-static conditions or overcomplicate them, making real-time application challenging. Additionally, many existing models neglect the critical coupling between the robot's body and actuator dynamics, a factor essential for accurate control. In this paper, we propose a new, minimal dynamics model for CDCRs that strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy. Our model captures the essential dynamics of both the robot and its actuators, providing a practical tool for control design.

Consequently, even with a single set of drive units, the ACR can operate in multiple modes, enabling variable motion performance and workspace adaptability, effectively reducing the number of motors. The ACR's stiffness also varies with the locking state of its SLJs, and no motor drive is required to maintain its shape when all SLJs are self-locking.

Grasping 3,Multi-Object Grasping -- Experience Forest for Robotic Finger Movement Strategies,"Chen, Tianze;Sun, Yu","Keywords: Logistics, Grasping","Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Experience Forest algorithm designed for multi-object grasping (MOG). Different from single-object grasping, for MOG, the hand poses a few steps before the end of grasping play important roles in the success of MOG. But similar to single-object grasping, the hand poses that are far away from the end grasping pose are not as relevant. Therefore, the proposed approach invented the Experience Forest structure to organize the finger movement sequences collected in naive MOG approaches with a set of trees instead of a single tree. The algorithm propagates success or failure results in the trials from end-pose nodes only to the nodes representing several preceding hand poses. When using the trees to generate a grasping sequence, the algorithm generates a finger-movement policy that follows a MOG synergy at the beginning and then transits to a tree in the Experience Forest and then employs a breadth-first search to achieve a more reliable solution. Tested on various objects using a UR5e robotic arm and Barrett hand in both simulated and real environments, the strategy significantly boosts efficiency in object transfer tasks by up to 60%, marking a 10% improvement over our previous methods.",,,,,,
Grasping 3,VMF-Contact: Uncertainty-Aware Evidential Learning for Probabilistic Contact-Grasp in Noisy Clutter,"Shi, Yitian;Welte, Edgar;Gilles, Maximilian;Rayyes, Rania","Keywords: Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Grasping","Abstract: Grasp learning in noisy environments, such as occlusions, sensor noise, and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, poses significant challenges. Recent learning-based approaches focus primarily on capturing aleatoric uncertainty from inherent data noise. The epistemic uncertainty, which represents the OOD recognition, is often addressed by ensembles with multiple forward paths, limiting real-time application. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware approach for 6-DoF grasp detection using evidential learning to comprehensively capture both uncertainties in real-world robotic grasping. As a key contribution, we introduce vMF-Contact, a novel architecture for learning hierarchical contact grasp representations with probabilistic modeling of directional uncertainty as von MisesÂ–Fisher (vMF) distribution. To achieve this, we analyze the theoretical formulation of the second-order objective on the posterior parametrization, providing formal guarantees for the model's ability to quantify uncertainty and improve grasp prediction performance.

Grasping 3,Composing Dextrous Grasping and In-Hand Manipulation Via Scoring with a Reinforcement Learning Critic,"RÃ¶stel, Lennart;Winkelbauer, Dominik;Pitz, Johannes;Sievers, Leon;BÃ¤uml, Berthold","Keywords: Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, In-Hand Manipulation, Dexterous Manipulation","Abstract: In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies, reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping) states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system, enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.",,,,,,

As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience.

Localization 5,AIR-HLoc: Adaptive Retrieved Images Selection for Efficient Visual Localisation,"Liu, Changkun;Jiao, Jianhao;Huang, Huajian;Ma, Zhengyang;Kanoulas, Dimitrios;Braud, Tristan","Keywords: Localization, SLAM, Visual Learning","Abstract: State-of-the-art hierarchical localisation pipelines (HLoc) employ image retrieval (IR) to establish 2D-3D correspondences by selecting the top-k most similar images from a reference database. While increasing k improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing k, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts k based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach reduces computational costs and processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30% while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy. The results demonstrate that AIR-HLoc facilitates a latency-sensitive localisation system.",,,,,,

However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approach, our method achieves a 3x faster training speed and a 45x reduction in model storage.

Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature.

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.",,,,,,

Existing coverage approaches reduce coverage time by covering along the minimum number of coverage lines (straight-line paths). However, recomputing such paths online can be computationally expensive resulting in robot stoppages that increase coverage time. A naive alternative is greedy detour replanning, i.e., replanning with minimum deviation from the initial path, which is efficient to compute but may result in unnecessary detours. In this work, we propose an anytime coverage replanning approach named OARP-Replan that performs near-optimal replans to an interrupted coverage path within a given time budget. We do this by solving linear relaxations of integer linear programs (ILPs) to identify sections of the interrupted path that can be optimally replanned within the time budget. We validate OARP-Replan in simulation and perform comparisons against a greedy detour replanner and other state-of-the-art coverage planners.

In this article, we introduce LeTac-MPC, a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for tactile-reactive grasping. Our approach enables the gripper to grasp objects with different physical properties on dynamic and force-interactive tasks. We utilize a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight (Yuan et al. 2017), which is capable of perceiving high-resolution tactile feedback that contains information on the physical properties and states of the grasped object.

Even with state-of-the-art robot learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions, visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control.

However, humans might be intimidated by the autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots due to perceived risks and a lack of trust. This paper proposed a trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy that allows robots to seamlessly adjust their autonomy level, striving to optimize team performance and enhance their acceptance among human collaborators. By enhancing the relational event modeling framework with Bayesian learning techniques, this paper enables dynamic inference of human trust based solely on time-stamped relational events communicated within human-robot teams. Adopting a longitudinal perspective on trust development and calibration in human-robot teams, the proposed trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy warrants robots to actively establish, maintain, and repair human trust, rather than merely passively adapting to it. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a user study on a human-robot collaborative search and rescue scenario. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate its merits on both task execution and user acceptability over the baseline approach that does not consider the preservation of trust.",,,,,,

Denial caused greater discomfort than apology or compensation across both violation types. Dispositional trust influenced repair strategies effectiveness, particularly in willingness to engage and re-engage.

Acceptability and Trust,Modeling Trust Dynamics in Robot-Assisted Delivery: Impact of Trust Repair Strategies,"Mangalindan, Dong Hae;Kandikonda, Karthik;Rovira, Ericka;Srivastava, Vaibhav","Keywords: Acceptability and Trust, Human-Robot Collaboration, Design and Human Factors","Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust. In this task, humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually control it while handling a secondary task. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long explanations, apology and promise, and denial. Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at preventing trust loss. We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.",,,,,,
Manipulation Planning and Control 1,Planning for Tabletop Object Rearrangement,"Hu, Jiaming;Szczekulski, Jan;Peddabomma, Sudhansh;Christensen, Henrik Iskov","Keywords: Manipulation Planning, Mobile Manipulation","Abstract: Finding an high-quality solution for the tabletop object rearrangement planning is a challenging problem. Compared to determining a goal arrangement, rearrangement planning is challenging due to the dependencies between objects and the buffer capacity available to hold objects. Although ORLA* has proposed an A* based searching strategy with lazy evaluation for the optimal solution, it is not scalable, with the success rate decreasing as the number of objects increases. Additionally, for noisy state representations, ORLA* provides only suboptimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced A*-based algorithm that improves state representation and employs incremental goal attempts with lazy evaluation at each iteration. This approach aims to enhance scalability while maintaining solution quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can provide superior solutions compared to ORLA*, in a shorter time, for both stationary and mobile robots.",,,,,,

Enabling robots to perform tasks that require the coordinated use of two arms, is essential for complex manipulation tasks such as handling complex large objects, assembling components, and performing human-like interactions. However, achieving effective dual-arm manipulation is challenging due to the need for precise coordination, dynamic adaptability, and the ability to manage interaction forces between the arms and the objects being manipulated. We propose a novel pipeline that combines advantages of policy learning based on environment feedback and gradient based optimization to learn controller gains as well as the control outputs. This allows the robotic system to dynamically modulate its impedance in response to task demands, ensuring stability and dexterity in dual-arm operations. We evaluate our pipeline on a trajectory-tracking task involving a variety of large, complex objects with different masses and geometries. The performance is then compared to three other established methods for controlling dual-arm robots, demonstrating superior results.",,,,,,
Manipulation Planning and Control 1,Goal-Driven Robotic Pushing Manipulation under Uncertain Object Properties,"Lee, Yongseok;Kim, Keehoon","Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Manipulation Planning, Model Learning for Control","Abstract: Robotic pushing is one of the intuitive non-prehensile manipulation skills that can handle ungraspable objects without any complex task-specific tools. In this paper, we proposed a goal-driven accurate robotic pushing framework to achieve the robotic pushing tasks in practice that can operate under uncertain object properties. We employed a model predictive path integral (MPPI) as a goal-driven pushing controller building upon our prior work to operate pushing tasks under uncertain object properties. Unlike our prior work, the proposed framework can push the object toward the goal pose without predefined trajectories. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed framework can accomplish the pushing task with a significantly shorter total length, smaller total step, and a higher success rate even though the model parameters are unknown. Moreover, we demonstrated the proposed framework also works well in the real world through real-robot demonstrations.",,,,,,
Manipulation Planning and Control 1,Synthesizing Grasps and Regrasps for Complex Manipulation Tasks,"Patankar, Aditya;Mahalingam, Dasharadhan;Chakraborty, Nilanjan","Keywords: Grasping, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: In complex manipulation tasks, e.g., manipulation by pivoting, the motion of the object being manipulated has to satisfy path constraints that can change during the motion. Therefore, a single grasp may not be sufficient for the entire path, and the object may need to be regrasped. Additionally, geometric data for objects from a sensor are usually available in the form of point clouds. The problem of computing grasps and regrasps from point-cloud representation of objects for complex manipulation tasks is a key problem in endowing robots with manipulation capabilities beyond pick-and-place. In this paper, we formalize the problem of grasping/regrasping for complex manipulation tasks with objects represented by (partial) point clouds and present an algorithm to solve it. We represent a complex manipulation task as a sequence of constant screw motions. Using a manipulation plan skeleton as a sequence of constant screw motions, we use a grasp metric to find graspable regions on the object for every constant screw segment. The overlap of the graspable regions for contiguous screws are then used to determine when and how many times the object needs to be regrasped. We present experimental results on point cloud data collected from RGB-D sensors to illustrate our approach.",,,,,,

We introduce a probabilistic real-time approach that leverages the human hand as a prior to mitigate these uncertainties. By tracking the constrained motion of the human hand during manipulation and explicitly modeling uncertainties in visual observations, our method reliably estimates an objectÂ’s kinematic model online. We validate our approach on a novel dataset featuring challenging objects that are occluded during manipulation and offer limited articulations for perception. The results demonstrate that by incorporating an appropriate prior and explicitly accounting for uncertainties, our method produces accurate estimates, outperforming two recent baselines by 195% and 140%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach's estimates are precise enough to allow a robot to manipulate even small objects safely.",,,,,,

Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.",,,,,,
Learning for Manipulation and Navigation,Interaction-Driven Updates: 3D Scene Graph Maintenance During Robot Task Execution,"Li, Qingfeng;Zhang, Xinlei;Chen, Chen;Niu, Jianwei;Zhao, Haochen","Keywords: Semantic Scene Understanding, Cognitive Control Architectures, Embodied Cognitive Science","Abstract: Robots powered by large language model (LLM) demonstrate significant research and application potential by effectively interpreting scene information to respond to human commands. However, when robots rely on static scene information during task execution, they face difficulties in adapting to changes in the environment, posing a major challenge for dynamic scene perception. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative interaction-driven approach to enhance robots' ability to perceive dynamic scene information. This approach consists of two contributions, the observation point selection module and the dynamic scene maintenance module. Specifically, first, the robot uses the 3D scene graph (3DSG) containing assets and objects to perceive static scene information through the LLM planner. Next, the best observation point for each asset is obtained through the observation point selection module. Then, with the help of the best observation point, the dynamic scene maintenance module interacts with the asset-related objects to dynamically update all the object node information related to the asset node. This approach enables robots to maintain dynamic scene information, enhancing their adaptability in unpredictable environments and improving task reliability.We evaluated our method using the iTHOR and RoboTHOR datasets within the AI2-THOR simulator and in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively and accurately maintains robots' perception of dynamic scene information.",,,,,,

Learning for Manipulation and Navigation,Jailbreaking LLM-Controlled Robots,"Robey, Alexander;Ravichandran, Zachary;Kumar, Vijay;Hassani, Hamed;Pappas, George J.","Keywords: AI-Enabled Robotics, Robot Safety, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive human-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and self-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit harmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of deploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first algorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual attacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from LLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three scenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the NVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker has partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a GPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only query access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each scenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we demonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds jailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates. Our results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs extend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that jailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our results on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a deployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is critical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media is available at: https://robopair.org.",,,,,,

In this paper, we introduce Constraints as Specifications through LLMs (CaStL), a framework that identifies constraints such as goal conditions, action ordering, and action blocking from natural language in multiple stages. CaStL translates these constraints into PDDL and Python scripts, which are solved using an custom PDDL solver. Tested across three PDDL domains, CaStL significantly improves constraint handling and planning success rates from natural language specification in complex scenarios.",,,,,,
Learning for Manipulation and Navigation,Skills Made to Order: Efficient Acquisition of Robot Cooking Skills Guided by Multiple Forms of Internet Data,"Verghese, Mrinal;Atkeson, Christopher","Keywords: AI-Enabled Robotics, Learning from Demonstration, Big Data in Robotics and Automation","Abstract: This study explores the utility of various internet data sources to select among a set of template robot behaviors to perform skills. Learning contact-rich skills involving tool use from internet data sources has typically been challenging due to the lack of physical information such as contact existence, location, areas, and force in this data. Prior works have generally used internet data and foundation models trained on this data to generate low-level robot behavior. We hypothesize that these data and models may be better suited to selecting among a set of basic robot behaviors to perform these contact-rich skills. We explore three methods of template selection: querying large language models, comparing video of robot execution to retrieved human video using features from a pretrained video encoder common in prior work, and performing the same comparison using features from an optic flow encoder trained on internet data. Our results show that LLMs are surprisingly capable template selectors despite their lack of visual information, optical flow encoding significantly outperforms video encoders trained with an order of magnitude more data, and important synergies exist between various forms of internet data for template selection. By exploiting these synergies, we create a template selector using multiple forms of internet data that achieves a 79% success rate on a set of 16 different cooking skills involving tool-use.",,,,,,

To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots.
In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance the LLM's ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations.

We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic (LTLf). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on LTLf and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.",,,,,,

We build DARE upon an attention-based encoder and a diffusion model, and introduce ground truth optimal demonstrations for training to learn better patterns for exploration. The trained planner can reason about the partial belief to recognize the potential structure in unknown areas and consider these areas during path planning.

Diffusion Models,NaviDiffusor: Cost-Guided Diffusion Model for Visual Navigation,"Zeng, Yiming;Ren, Hao;Wang, Shuhang;Huang, Junlong;Cheng, Hui","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Integrated Planning and Learning, Imitation Learning","Abstract: Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods.

Existing reinforcement learning methods cannot be directly transferred to new environments, as they typically rely on extensive mapping and exploration, leading to time-consuming and inefficient. To address these challenges, we try to transfer the logical knowledge and the generalization ability of pre-trained foundation models to zero-shot navigation. By integrating a large vision-language model with a diffusion network, our approach named NavigateDiff constructs a visual predictor that continuously predicts the agent's potential observations in the next step which can assist robots generate robust actions. Furthermore, to adapt the temporal property of navigation, we introduce temporal historical information to ensure that the predicted image is aligned with the navigation scene.

However, these techniques often struggle to adapt behavior to new preferences or changes in the environment. To address these limitations, we propose Fine-tuning Diffusion Policy with Human Preference (FDPP). FDPP learns a reward function through preference-based learning. This reward is then used to fine-tune the pre-trained policy with reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in alignment of pre-trained policy with new human preferences while still solving the original task. Our experiments across various robotic tasks and preferences demonstrate that FDPP effectively customizes policy behavior without compromising performance.

Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis.

Given an open- or closed-loop policy and a finite set of trajectory rollouts under the policy, we bound the expected value, value-at-risk, and conditional-value-at-risk of the trajectory cost, and the probability of failure in a sparse cost setting. The bounds hold, with user-specified probability, for any policy synthesis technique and can be seen as a post-design safety certification. Generating the bounds only requires sampling simulation rollouts, without assumptions on the distribution or complexity of the underlying stochastic system. We adapt these bounds to also give a constraint satisfaction test to verify safety of the robot system. We provide a thorough analysis of the bound sensitivity to sim-to-real distribution shifts and provide results for constructing robust bounds that can tolerate some specified amount of distribution shift. Furthermore, we extend our method to apply when selecting the best policy from a set of candidates, requiring a multi-hypothesis correction. We show the statistical validity of our bounds in the Ant, Half-cheetah, and Swimmer MuJoCo environments and demonstrate our constraint satisfaction test with the Ant. Finally, using the 20 degree-of-freedom MuJoCo Shadow Hand, we show the necessity of the multi-hypothesis correction.",,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes.

SLAM 6,Certifiably Correct Range-Aided SLAM,"Papalia, Alan;Fishberg, Andrew;O'Neill, Brendan;How, Jonathan;Rosen, David;Leonard, John","Keywords: SLAM, Range Sensing, Optimization and Optimal Control, Certifiable Perception","Abstract: We present the first algorithm to efficiently compute certifiably optimal solutions to range-aided simultaneous localization and mapping (RA-SLAM) problems. Robotic navigation systems increasingly incorporate point-to-point ranging sensors, leading to state estimation problems in the form of RA-SLAM. However, the RA-SLAM problem is significantly more difficult to solve than traditional pose-graph SLAM: ranging sensor models introduce non-convexity and single range measurements do not uniquely determine the transform between the involved sensors. As a result, RA-SLAM inference is sensitive to initial estimates yet lacks reliable initialization techniques. Our approach, certifiably correct RA-SLAM (CORA), leverages a novel quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation of RA-SLAM to relax the RA-SLAM problem to a semidefinite program (SDP). CORA solves the SDP efficiently using the Riemannian Staircase methodology; the SDP solution provides both (i) a lower bound on the RA-SLAM problem's optimal value, and (ii) an approximate solution of the RA-SLAM problem, which can be subsequently refined using local optimization. CORA applies to problems with arbitrary pose-pose, pose-landmark, and ranging measurements and, due to using convex relaxation, is insensitive to initialization. We evaluate CORA on several real-world problems. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, CORA is able to obtain high-quality solutions on all problems despite being initialized with random values. Additionally, we study the tightness of the SDP relaxation with respect to important problem parameters: the number of (i) robots, (ii) landmarks, and (iii) range measurements. These experiments demonstrate that the SDP relaxation is often tight and reveal relationships between graph connectivity and the tightness of the SDP relaxation.",,,,,,

SLAM 6,A Consistent Parallel Estimation Framework for Visual-Inertial SLAM,"Huai, Zheng;Huang, Guoquan (Paul)","Keywords: SLAM, Visual-Based Navigation, Sensor Fusion, Estimation Consistency","Abstract: In this article, we revisit the optimal fusion of visual and inertial information from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit and propose a novel parallel visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) estimation framework in favor of the multithread computation on a single CPU. We start modeling the SLAM problem with a Bayesian batch estimator, and then split it into two submodules, localization and mapping, of different scales and processing rates, however, can thus run concurrently. The estimation consistency is taken into account in decoupling the two submodules so that when loop closure occurs the localization accuracy can seamlessly benefit from the mapping result via online global optimization, which distinguishes our solution from the others. To this end, we design the corresponding front-end and back-end to consistently solve localization and mapping in parallel, especially the hybrid robocentric and world-centric formulations are used for modeling the respective problems. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both the synthetic data generated for Monte-Carlo simulations and diverse real datasets acquired in highly-dynamic, long-term, and large-scale SLAM scenarios. Simulation results validate the significantly improved consistency and accuracy by applying our method. Experimental results show the better (competitive at least) performance against a state-of-the-art method, while being capable of processing a huge amount of measurements in building large-scale maps without blocking the high-accuracy real-time localization outputs.",,,,,,
Pose Estimation,Depth-Based Efficient PnP: A Rapid and Accurate Method for Camera Pose Estimation,"Xie, Xinyue;Zou, Deyue","Keywords: SLAM, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach, DEPnP (Depth-based Efficient PnP), addressing the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem crucial in vision-based navigation and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in robotics and automation, which estimates the pose of a calibrated camera by observing the 2D projections of known 3D points onto the camera image plane. The method employs eight variables to control the depth of control points and orientation of camera, formulating camera pose estimation as an optimization task. By optimizing these variables utilizing mean-subtracted rotation equations, rapid and accurate camera pose estimation is achieved.

The L-EKF fuses end-effector accelerometer and rate gyroscope measurements with cable-length measurements. The main contribution compared to prior CDPR pose estimation EKF methods is that the L-EKF framework does not require an iterative forward kinematics algorithm to be solved each time step, reducing the computation time of the EKF. Moreover, the L-EKF is amenable to the inclusion of colored measurement noise, which provides a more realistic quantification of the kinematic uncertainty present in the cable-length measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the L-EKF is computationally more efficient than previous forward-kinematics-based EKF methods, as well as the moderate improvement in pose estimation provided by the colored noise model.",,,,,,
Pose Estimation,A Unified End-To-End Network for Category-Level and Instance-Level Object Pose Estimation from RGB Images,"Ren, Jiale;Liu, Hong;Liu, Jinfu;Jiang, Peifeng","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Visual Learning, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Accurately estimating the 6-DoF pose of objects is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and robotics. While category-level pose estimation based on RGBD data has achieved good performance in recent years, estimating poses solely from RGB images remains a significant challenge. Existing RGB-based category-level methods primarily focus on recovering object point clouds from RGB images, and pose prediction is not performed end-to-end by a network. This paper presents a Category-level and Instance-level Pose Estimation Network (CIPE), which models pose estimation as a set prediction problem and enables direct pose regression from RGB images. To further enhance the network's ability to learn object poses, first, a novel learnable rotation representation that redefines rotation learning within Euclidean space is introduced to facilitate rotation regression. Additionally, we propose a prior-query fusion strategy that utilizes a pre-trained point cloud feature extraction network to integrate categorical object features with bounding boxes, thereby improving the incorporation of category information. Experimental results demonstrate that CIPE significantly outperforms existing RGB-based methods on both category-level and instance-level datasets.

Monocular cameras, known for their lightweight design, cost-effectiveness, and versatility, present a promising solution for these tasks. However, relying solely on monocular cameras for comprehensive perception and communication presents significant challenges. To address this, we introduce MonoLDP, a novel system that leverages monocular cameras for depth estimation, mutual pose estimation, and visible light communication in indoor environments, providing an integrated framework to overcome these limitations. MonoLDP features a two-stage network: (1) a depth estimation module that infers depth from monocular images, and (2) a depth-guided 3D object recognition network for agent-relative localization and pose estimation.

However, existing pose estimation techniques face significant challenges, as camera-based systems either rely on markers, which are prone to damage, or struggle with depth estimation inaccuracies. Additionally, 3D sensor-based approaches, particularly point cloud registration (PCR), face challenges such as initial pose errors, high-latency inference, and difficulties in object identification based purely on geometric features. To address these limitations, we propose LCSPose, a LiDAR-camera fusion-based 6-DoF pose estimation method that is marker-free, accurate, efficient, and scalable. Our approach integrates three key modules: (1) a semantic-geometric segmentation module for spreader segmentation and outlier removal, (2) a spatial consistency template sampling module based on Spatial Consistency Score (SC-Score) for reliable template selection across varying distances, and (3) a multi-view coarse-to-fine pose refinement module which incorporates multi-view PCA alignment for robust initial posture prior estimation and iterative pose refinement strategy for long-range registration.

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.",,,,,,
Pose Estimation,Virtual Frame Rotation: A Novel Two-Stage Pose Estimation Scheme of Permanent Magnet Marker for Medical Applications,"Park, Jiho;Lim, Buyong;Yoon, Jungwon","Keywords: Medical Robots and Systems, Micro/Nano Robots, Localization","Abstract: Permanent magnetic marker (PMM) has the potential to broaden the scope of medical robots by facilitating the localization of target points even in environments where vision-based methods cannot operate. However, conventional approaches rely on the accuracy of the modeling equations and are not adaptable to changes in the magnet's properties, which can occur due to factors like non-uniformity in the marker material or temperature fluctuations within the PMM. These constraints make it challenging to apply the PMM across diverse medical techniques. In this work, we introduce a novel two-stage PMM localization scheme, called Virtual Frame Rotation (VFR), designed to address this issue. VFR employs an approach that virtually rotates the observation frame of the hall sensors' output vector and checks the symmetry of the magnetic field in the rotated frame. This approach allows for robust pose estimation of the condition with variance in magnetic properties, as verified by comparing its localization performance with the conventional approach in the simulation and the real-world environments with temperature variance conditions. Based on these characteristics, VFR can expand the scope of medical applications that involve changes in the properties of magnetic markers, such as the in-body localization of magnetic macro particles for hyperthermia treatment.",,,,,,

BER aims to enhance learning efficiency in systems with approximate reversibility, reducing the need for complex reward shaping. The method constructs reversed trajectories using back-stepping transitions to reach random or fixed targets. Interpretable as a bi-directional approach, BER addresses inaccuracies in back-stepping transitions through a purification of the replay experience during learning. Given the intricate nature of soft robots and their complex interactions with environments, we present an application of BER in a model-free RL approach for the locomotion and navigation of a soft snake robot, which is capable of serpentine motion enabled by anisotropic friction between the body and ground. In addition, a dynamic simulator is developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the BER algorithm, in which the robot demonstrates successful learning (reaching a 100% success rate) and adeptly reaches random targets, achieving an average speed 48% faster than that of the best baseline approach.",,,,,,

However, existing computational methods struggle to accurately and efficiently analyze the highly dynamic, complex, and fine structures of sperm flagella, especially when portions of the flagellum become invisible due to three-dimensional out-of-focus beating. This paper proposes an automated high-throughput tool for quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating. The core innovation is continuous convolution (CConv), which adaptively captures the irregular, time-varying patterns of sperm flagella while ensuring continuity in segmentation outputs, even in the presence of locally invisible regions caused by out-of-focus motion. CConv can be integrated into various neural network architectures as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating CConv consistently improves the accuracy and continuity of flagella segmentation across different networks. Furthermore, utilizing a curvature-based approach, we quantified key flagellar beating parameters, including length, amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. Applying the high-throughput tool on 1200 sperm revealed that sperm from fertile donors had significantly higher flagellar beating frequency than sperm from infertile patients. The proposed automated tool unlocks high-throughput, quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating, showing the potential for applications in reproductive biology and engineering research.",,,,,,

Biologists attribute this to a chain of segmental neuron clusters (ganglia) within insect nervous systems, which act as distributed, self-organizing sensorimotor control units. Inspired by the neural structure of the Carausius morosus, the common stick insect, this research introduces the Distributed Neural Locomotion Controller (D-NLC), a modular control framework utilizing local proprioceptive feedback to modulate joint-level Central Pattern Generator (CPG) signals to produce emergent locomotive behaviors. We implemented this framework using a modular legged robot with distributed joint-level embedded computing units and assessed its performance and behavior under various experimental settings. Based on real-world experiments, we observe an overall 31.3% average increase in curvilinear motion performance under external (terrain) and internal (amputation) disturbances compared to a centralized predefined gait controller. This difference is statistically significant (P<<0.05) for larger perturbations but not for single-leg amputations. Experiments with perturbation-induced leg stance duration and leg-phase-difference analysis further validated our hypothesis regarding D-NLC's role in the robust perceptive locomotion and self-emergent gait adaptation against complex unforeseen perturbations. This proposed control framework does not require any numerical optimization or weight training processes, which are time-consuming and computationally expensive.

However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity of the equations of motion.

This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and (2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as hardware experiments on Digit.",,,,,,
Perception for Manipulation 1,ViTa-Zero: Zero-Shot Visuotactile Object 6D Pose Estimation,"Li, Hongyu;Akl, James;Sridhar, Srinath;Brady, Tye;Padir, Taskin","Keywords: Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Force and Tactile Sensing, Sensor Fusion","Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a springÂ–mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.",,,,,,
Perception for Manipulation 1,PhysPart: Physically Plausible Part Completion for Interactable Objects,"Luo, Rundong;Geng, Haoran;Deng, Congyue;Li, Puhao;Wang, Zan;Jia, Baoxiong;Guibas, Leonidas;Huang, Siyuan","Keywords: Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: Interactable objects are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recent advances in 3D generative models make it possible to automate the modeling of these objects, benefiting a range of applications from 3D printing to the creation of robot simulation environments. However, while significant progress has been made in modeling 3D shapes and appearances, modeling object physics, particularly for interactable objects, remains challenging due to the physical constraints imposed by inter-part motions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of physically plausible part completion for interactable objects, aiming to generate 3D parts that not only fit precisely into the object but also allow smooth part motions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based part generation model that utilizes geometric conditioning through classifier-free guidance and formulates physical constraints as a set of stability and mobility losses to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we demonstrate the generation of dependent parts, paving the way toward sequential part generation for objects with complex part-whole hierarchies. Experimentally, we introduce a new metric for measuring physical plausibility based on motion success rates. Our model outperforms existing baselines over shape and physical metrics, especially those that do not adequately model physical constraints. We also demonstrate our applications in 3D printing, robot manipulation, and sequential part generation, showing our strength in realistic tasks with the demand for high physical plausibility.",,,,,,

However, existing methods often struggle with unknown objects and require retraining, limiting their practicality. Traditional 3D point-pair feature methods, while training-free, perform poorly with textured symmetric objects. We propose a generalizable approach for zero-shot 6D pose estimation without retraining. Our method consists of two steps: generating CAD-based templates through real-time rendering for coarse pose estimation, and refining poses using semantic point-pair features aligned with the camera viewpoint. We conducted experiments on seven core datasets from the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation (BOP) challenge, and the results are publicly available on the BOP website. Integration into a robotic grasping system further highlights its high precision and fast execution, making it idealfor applications such as bin-picking.",,,,,,

Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.",,,,,,

At first, a mesh is fitted on data points acquired from the objectÂ’s surface, based on a single primitive template. Subsequently, the mesh is properly adjusted to adequately represent local deformities. Moreover, a novel proactive tactile exploration strategy aims at minimizing the total uncertainty with the least number of contacts, while reducing the risk of contact failure in case the estimated surface differs significantly from the real one. The performance of the methodology is evaluated both in 3D simulation and on a real setup.",,,,,,

Multi-view pose estimation methods offer significant advantages over single-view methods by providing more comprehensive information, effectively handling occlusions and lack of features, and resolving depth ambiguities. However, current multi-view methods often rely on late-stage information fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit complementary multi-view data.
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance multi-view 6D pose estimation by introducing a Feature Exchange Transformer (FET) for early-stage feature fusion. This approach leverages self-attention and epipolar cross-attention mechanisms to enable multi-layer feature aggregation across views. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for an efficient feature exchange at multiple network layers. Our method, implemented on top of EpiSurfEmb, enhances the utilization of multi-view information, leading to significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging bin-picking scenarios.

Utilizing a smart glasses platform developed by Biel Glasses, which provide a continuous stream of stereo images and GPS fixes, we generate an textit{Event Map} based on key semantic elements extracted by carefully prompted visual question-answering (VQA) models. For individuals with blurry or reduced fields of vision (low vision), traversing city streets poses a variety of challenges; they may struggle to perceive construction work, potholes, crowded sidewalks, and other ambiguous obstacles obstructing their paths. Some tasks, such as distinguishing traffic light signals, are nigh impossible without assistance from a companion or city infrastructure aimed towards accessibility. Although the majority of these problems may be solved with individually tailored traditional computer vision algorithms, developing and running a suite of these algorithms is challenging and resource demanding.

This paper proposes GE-MVS, a novel multi-view stereo network with geometric encoding for more accurate and complete depth estimation and point cloud reconstruction. First, the cross-view adaptive cost volume aggregation module is proposed to strengthen multi-view geometric cues encoding during cost volume construction. Then, the depth consistency optimization is performed in the 3D point space during learning by invoking ground-truth depth cues from adjacent views. Finally, the surface normal geometries are explicitly encoded to refine the sampled depth hypotheses to be consistent in the local neighbor regions. Extensive experiments on the standard MVS benchmarks including DTU, Tanks and Temples, and BlendedMVS demonstrate the state-of-the-art depth estimation and point cloud reconstruction performance of GE-MVS.

Aerial Robots 4,Airflow Source Seeking on Small Quadrotors Using a Single Flow Sensor,"Thomas, Lenworth;Bridges, Tjaden;Bergbreiter, Sarah","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Environment Monitoring and Management, Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning","Abstract: As environmental disasters happen more frequently and severely, seeking the source of pollutants or harmful particulates using plume tracking becomes even more important. Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small drones. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors (<100 g). We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.",,,,,,

Unlike unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, where the agent individual is able to move freely, IAPs connect UAV agents with mechanical joints, such as spherical joints, and form a rigid central platform, limiting the degree of freedom (DOF) of agents. Traditional methods, which rely on forming loop closures, object detection, or range sensors, suffer from degeneration or inefficiency due to the restricted relative motion between agents.

Localization has long been an essential area of research within robotics. The popularity of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to solve different tasks has increased and is expected to continue. Developing a robust complementary system to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) used today has been researched, and visual localization using cameras and satellite images is a popular choice to use.

Multi-Robot Systems 4,Overlapping Free: Anchorless UWB-Assisted Relative Pose Estimation for Multi-Robot Systems,"Yun, Yanpu;Peng, Guohao;Zhou, Yichen;Zhang, Jun;Liu, Yiyao;Mao, Kaimin;Wang, Danwei",Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems,"Abstract: Accurate Relative Pose Estimation (RPE) is critical for effective collaboration of multi-robot systems. Traditional methods using cameras or LiDARs heavily rely on overlapping Fields of View (FoV) between robots, which is highly demanding in practical applications and may hinder collaboration efficiency. To accommodate this issue, we propose Anchorless UWB-Assisted Relative Pose Estimation (AURPE), a novel approach that leverages ultra-wideband (UWB) technology in an anchorless setup to achieve multi-robot RPE without requiring overlapping FoVs or external infrastructure. AURPE first estimates the initial relative poses between robots using inter-robot UWB ranging combined with a Bayesian framework and constrained optimization. During robot operation, AURPE continuously refines the relative poses by integrating UWB measurements with LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and employs a consensus voting mechanism to identify the most reliable pose estimates. Additionally, a pose graph-based back-end optimization is incorporated to enhance the accuracy of both initial and real-time relative pose. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that AURPE achieves accurate RPE even in non-overlapping scenarios where traditional methods fail. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods, AURPE shows superior performance in both accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance cooperative tasks in multi-robot systems operating in complex environments.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Systems 4,Maintaining Strong R-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks Using Control Barrier Functions,"Lee, Haejoon;Panagou, Dimitra","Keywords: Networked Robots, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong r-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.",,,,,,

While current research on plan and goal recognition provide powerful tools, most of them rely on a high-level abstraction of the environment and of its dynamics. We propose online waypoint recognition (OWR) that incorporates knowledge about the dynamic models into the analysis of the observed agent behavior. Our algorithm takes the form of a Kalman filter and performs recognition of the agent's intended waypoint at high frequency. The approach is robust to uncertainties in dynamics and observations. Moreover, it does not require the agent to reach the next waypoint to perform recognition, which saves valuable time. Our empirical evaluation shows the ability of our proposed algorithm to expedite recognition of both simulated and real-world mobile robots.",,,,,,

Recent research has often focused on the scalability of the number of robots or the complexity of the environment. Usually, they disregard the robots' physical models or use a differential drive robot. However, this approach fails to adequately capture the kinematic and dynamic constraints of real-world vehicles, particularly those equipped with Ackermann steering in warehousing applications. This paper presents a novel MAPF algorithm that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a lattice planner. RL provides strong generalization capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. By incorporating lattice planner trajectories into the action space of the RL framework, agents are capable of generating smooth and feasible paths that respect the kinematic and dynamic constraints. In addition, we adopt a decentralized training and execution framework, where a network of shared value functions enables efficient cooperation among agents during decision-making. Simulation results and real-world experiments in different scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of success rate, average speed, extra distance of trajectory, and computing time.",,,,,,
Multi-Robot Systems 4,Robust Self-Reconfiguration for Fault-Tolerant Control of Modular Aerial Robot Systems,"Huang, Rui;Tang, Siyu;Cai, Zhiqian;Zhao, Lin","Keywords: Cellular and Modular Robots, Failure Detection and Recovery, Aerial Systems: Applications","Abstract: Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units assembled into a single, integrated rigid flying platform. With inherent redundancy, MARS can self-reconfigure into different configurations to mitigate rotor or unit failures and maintain stable flight. However, existing works on MARS self-reconfiguration often overlook the practical controllability of intermediate structures formed during the reassembly process, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we address this gap by considering the control-constrained dynamic model of MARS and proposing a robust and efficient self-reconstruction algorithm that maximizes the controllability margin at each intermediate stage. Specifically, we develop algorithms to compute optimal, controllable disassembly and assembly sequences, enabling robust self-reconfiguration. Finally, we validate our method in several challenging fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both controllability and trajectory tracking while reducing the number of assembly steps.

When conventional global positioning infrastructure such as GPS is unavailable, the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology on each agent provides a practical means to measure inter-agent range, eliminating the need for external hardware installations, due to UWBÂ’s precise range measurements and robust communi- cation capabilities. However, when only a single UWB device per agent is used, the relative pose between the agents can be unobservable, resulting in a complex solution space with multiple possible RPs. In this paper, a novel method is proposed based on an Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) that fuses single UWB ranges with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed decentralized method solves the multi-modal solution in 3D (4-DoF) for the RP when it is unobservable. Moreover, a pseudo-state is introduced to correct for rotational drift of the agents. Through simulations and experiments involving two robots, the proposed solution was shown to be competitive, but less computationally expensive.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for tracking event blobs using raw events asynchronously in real time. We introduce the concept of an event blob as a spatio-temporal likelihood of event occurrence where the conditional spatial likelihood is blob-like. Many real-world objects such as car headlights or any quickly moving foreground objects generate event blob data. The proposed algorithm uses a nearest neighbour classifier with a dynamic threshold criteria for data association coupled with an extended Kalman filter to track the event blob state. Our algorithm achieves highly accurate blob tracking, velocity estimation, and shape estimation even under challenging lighting conditions and high-speed motions (> 11000 pixels/s). The microsecond time resolution achieved means that the filter output can be used to derive secondary information such as time-to-contact or range estimation, that will enable applications to real-world problems such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving.",,,,,,
Robot Vision 1,Deep Height Decoupling for Precise Vision-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction,"Wu, Yuan;Yan, Zhiqiang;Wang, Zhengxue;Li, Xiang;Hui, Le;Yang, Jian","Keywords: Computer Vision for Transportation, Semantic Scene Understanding","Abstract: The task of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct 3D geometry and estimate its semantic classes from 2D color images, where the 2D-to-3D view transformation is an indispensable step. Most previous methods conduct forward projection, such as BEVPooling and VoxelPooling, both of which map the 2D image features into 3D grids. However, the current grid representing features within a certain height range usually introduces many confusing features that belong to other height ranges. To address this challenge, we present Deep Height Decoupling (DHD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit height prior to filter out the confusing features. Specifically, DHD first predicts height maps via explicit supervision. Based on the height distribution statistics, DHD designs Mask Guided Height Sampling (MGHS) to adaptively decouple the height map into multiple binary masks. MGHS projects the 2D image features into multiple subspaces, where each grid contains features within reasonable height ranges. Finally, a Synergistic Feature Aggregation (SFA) module is deployed to enhance the feature representation through channel and spatial affinities, enabling further occupancy refinement. On the popular Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with minimal input frames. Source code is released at https://github.com/yanzq95/DHD.",,,,,,

Due to the lack of high-quality 3D data, directly training a general-purpose segmentation model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) have revolutionized the 2D computer vision field with outstanding performance, making the use of VFM to assist 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted methods do not effectively address the 2D-3D inconsistency problem or adequately provide corresponding semantic information for 3D instance objects. To address these two issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for 3D zero-shot instance segmentation called RE0. For the given 3D point clouds and multi-view RGB-D images with poses, we leverage the 3D geometric information, projection relationships, and CLIP semantic features. Specifically, we utilize CropFormer to extract mask information from multi-view posed images, combined with projection relationships to assign point-level labels to each point in the point cloud, and achieve instance- level consistency through inter-frame information interaction. Then, we employ projection relationships again to assign CLIP semantic features to the point cloud and achieve aggregation of small-scale point clouds. Notably, RE0 does not require any additional training and can be implemented by supporting only one inference of CropFormer and one inference of CLIP. Experiments on ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves higher quality segmentation than the previous zero-shot methods.

Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance.

As a result, labeled 3D datasets have largely been confined to the popular automotive domain due to the abundance of labeled data. Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However, VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label multi-frame 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) further enhances geometric consistency.

Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image can impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on the task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer uses patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, the spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.",,,,,,

To address these challenges, this paper unveils a novel system that utilizes event cameras. We introduce a dynamic visual marker and design event-based tracking algorithms to achieve fast localization and data streaming. Remarkably, the event camera's unique capabilities mitigate issues related to screen refresh rates and camera motion, enabling a high throughput of up to 114 Kbps in static conditions, and a 1 cm localization accuracy with 1% bit error rate under various camera motions.

To operate autonomously, C-Ray requires both accurate identification of when transitions between water and land occur and robust state estimation in littoral environments where the transition dynamics are highly discontinuous and transient. This paper presents a hybrid observer for estimating continuous states and identifying state-driven mode switches for C-Ray, enabling autonomous water/land-transitions.

The degraded perceptual conditions and sparse geometric information at longer ranges make the problem challenging especially when driving at high speeds. Furthermore, the sensing-to-mapping latency and the look-ahead map range can limit the maximum speed of the vehicle. Building on top of the recent work RoadRunner, in this work, we address the challenge of long-range (Â±100m) traversability estimation. Our RoadRunner (M&M) is an end-to-end learning-based framework that directly predicts the traversability and elevation maps at multiple ranges (Â±50m, Â±100m) and resolutions (0.2m, 0.8m) taking as input multiple images and a LiDAR voxel map. Our method is trained in a self-supervised manner by leveraging the dense supervision signal generated by fusing predictions from an existing traversability estimation stack (X-Racer) in hindsight and satellite Digital Elevation Maps. RoadRunner M&M achieves a significant improvement of up to 50% for elevation mapping and 30% for traversability estimation over RoadRunner, and is able to predict in 30% more regions compared to X-Racer while achieving real-time performance. Experiments on various out-of-distribution datasets also demonstrate that our data-driven approach starts to generalize to novel unstructured environments.

While it is intuitive to consider developing an automated rip current detection system to assist lifeguards in protecting beachgoers, rip current detection is in its infancy due to the lack of high-quality large-scale annotated rip current datasets. Also, the collection and annotation of rip current images require expert knowledge, which makes it more difficult to build datasets. So, this paper proposes a GAN-based rip current data augmentation method, RipGAN, to improve the performance of rip current detectors by increasing representative training data. To create new training images, RipGAN, has two branches. One is a texture generator that enriches the pattern and texture details of waves, making the image more realistic. The other is a rip generator based on FFFM-Unet. FFFM (Fast Fourier Fusion Module) uses Fast Fourier convolution to fuse the features from the low and the high layers, so as to further optimise the generated image. Furthermore, we trained Yolov8, YOLOv10, DINO and RT-DETR as rip current detectors to prove the effectiveness of RipGAN.

This setting presents two primary challenges: category-level ambiguity and instance-level complexity. Category-level ambiguity arises from representing objects of fine-grained categories in a highly sparse point cloud format, making category distinction challenging. Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the same category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding approach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances. In the category-level branch, we utilize extensive category knowledge from a pre-trained external detector to align object proposal features with sentence-level category features, thereby enhancing category awareness. In the instance-level branch, we utilize spatial relationship descriptions from language queries to refine object proposal features, ensuring clear differentiation among objects.

Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition.

Then, we use Shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) to transform the unfit points and reduce the data volume by quantizing the transformed coefficients. We design an adaptive bitrate control strategy based on QoE
as the optimization goal to control the quality of the transmitted point cloud. Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of 40x to 80x while maintaining high accuracy for downstream applications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70x. Fur thermore, in situations of reduced communication bandwidth, our adaptive bitrate control strategy demonstrates significant QoE improvements.",,,,,,
Language Guided Manipulation,A Shared Autonomy System for Precise and Efficient Remote Underwater Manipulation,"Phung, Amy;Billings, Gideon;Daniele, Andrea F;Walter, Matthew;Camilli, Richard","Keywords: Cognitive Human-Robot Interaction, Perception for Grasping and Manipulation, Virtual Reality and Interfaces, Shared Autonomy and Field Robotics","Abstract: Conventional underwater intervention operations using robotic vehicles require expert teleoperators and limit interaction with remote scientists. We present the SHared Autonomy for Remote Collaboration (SHARC) framework that enables novice operators to cooperatively conduct underwater sampling and manipulation tasks. With SHARC, operators can plan and complete manipulation tasks using natural language or hand gestures through a virtual reality (SHARC-VR) interface. The interface provides remote operators with a contextual 3D scene understanding that is updated according to bandwidth availability. Evaluation of the SHARC framework through controlled lab experiments demonstrates that SHARC-VR enables novice operators to complete manipulation tasks in framerate-limited conditions (i.e., 0.1Â–0.5 frames per second) faster than expert pilots using a conventional topside controller. For both novice and expert users, the SHARC-VR interface also increases the task completion rate and improves sampling precision. The SHARC framework is readily extensible to other hardware architectures, including terrestrial and space systems.",,,,,,
Language Guided Manipulation,E2Map: Experience-And-Emotion Map for Self-Reflective Robot Navigation with Language Models,"Kim, Chan;Kim, Keonwoo;Oh, Mintaek;Baek, Hanbi;Lee, Jiyang;Jung, Donghwi;Woo, Soojin;Woo, Younkyung;Tucker, John;Firoozi, Roya;Seo, Seung-Woo;Schwager, Mac;Kim, Seong-Woo","Keywords: AI-Enabled Robotics, Learning from Experience, Emotional Robotics","Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.",,,,,,
Language Guided Manipulation,Improving Zero-Shot ObjectNav with Generative Communication,"Dorbala, Vishnu Sashank;Sharma, Vishnu D.;Tokekar, Pratap;Manocha, Dinesh","Keywords: Agent-Based Systems, Domestic Robotics, AI-Enabled Robotics","Abstract: We propose a new method for improving Zero-Shot ObjectNav that aims to utilize potentially available environmental percepts for navigational assistance. Our approach takes into account that the ground agent may have limited and sometimes obstructed view. Our formulation encourages Generative Communication (GC) between an assistive overhead agent with a global view containing the target object and the ground agent with an obfuscated view; both equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for vision-to-language translation. In this assisted setup, the embodied agents communicate environmental information before the ground agent executes actions towards a target. Despite the overhead agent having a global view with the target, we note a drop in performance (-13% in OSR and -13% in SPL) of a fully cooperative assistance scheme over an unassisted baseline. In contrast, a selective assistance scheme where the ground agent retains its independent exploratory behaviour shows a 10% OSR and 7.65% SPL improvement. To explain navigation performance, we analyze the GC for unique traits, quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. Specifically, we identify the novel linguistic trait of preemptive hallucination in our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move, and note its strong correlation with navigation performance. We conduct real-world experiments and present some qualitative examples where we mitigate hallucinations via prompt finetuning to improve ObjectNav performance.",,,,,,
Language Guided Manipulation,Commonsense Reasoning for Legged Robot Adaptation with Vision-Language Models,"Chen, Annie;Lessing, Alec;Tang, Andy;Chada, Govind;Smith, Laura;Levine, Sergey;Finn, Chelsea","Keywords: AI-Based Methods, Autonomous Agents, Legged Robots","Abstract: Legged robots are physically capable of navigating a diverse variety of environments and overcoming a wide range of obstructions. For example, in a search and rescue mission, a legged robot could climb over debris, crawl through gaps, and navigate out of dead ends. However, the robotÂ’s controller needs to respond intelligently to such varied obstacles, and this requires handling unexpected and unusual scenarios successfully. This presents an open challenge to current learning methods, which often struggle with generalization to the long tail of unexpected situations without heavy human supervision. To address this issue, we investigate how to leverage the broad knowledge about the structure of the world and commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to aid legged robots in handling difficult, ambiguous situations. We propose a system, VLM-Predictive Control (VLM-PC), combining two key components that we find to be crucial for eliciting on-the-fly, adaptive behavior selection with VLMs: (1) in-context adaptation over previous robot interactions and (2) planning multiple skills into the future and replanning. We evaluate VLM-PC on several challenging real-world obstacle courses, involving dead ends and climbing and crawling, on a Go1 quadruped robot. Our experiments show that by reasoning over the history of interactions and future plans, VLMs enable the robot to autonomously perceive, navigate, and act in a wide range of complex scenarios that would otherwise require environment- specific engineering or human guidance.",,,,,,
Language Guided Manipulation,Language-Guided Object-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable and Collision-Aware Manipulation,"Li, Hang;Feng, Qian;Zheng, Zhi;Feng, Jianxiang;Chen, Zhaopeng;Knoll, Alois","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Manipulation Planning, Learning from Demonstration","Abstract: Learning from demonstrations faces challenges in generalizing beyond the training data and often lacks collision awareness. This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, ambiguous similar objects, while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving high success rate with few demonstrations. We train diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects and use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations, across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.",,,,,,

This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. Through this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That adds gesture conditioning alongside language to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments.

Robot Safety,Quantifying the Risk of Unmapped Associations for Mobile Robot Localization Safety,"Chen, Yihe;Pervan, Boris;Spenko, Matthew","Keywords: Robot Safety, Localization, Integrity Risk, Probability and Statistical Methods","Abstract: Integrity risk is a measure of localization safety that accounts for the presence of undetected sensor faults. The metric has been used for decades in aviation and has recently been applied to terrestrial robots
operating in life-critical missions. For ground vehicles, integrity risk can be quantified for systems using lidar measurements, where two
specific fault types have been identified: miss-association and unmapped association. While miss-association faults, which occur when a
correctly extracted feature is associated to the wrong landmark, have been well-studied, the probability of an unmapped association fault, where an incorrectly extracted feature is associated to a landmark, is not well-understood. Namely, previous research has never quantified this value and instead relies on an assumed value, one whose value has not been properly justified. This work is the first to provide a methodology that estimates the risk of unmapped association for each mapped landmark; the paper demonstrates the effect of this probability for both the chi-squared and fixed-lag smoothing methods for integrity monitoring.

Robot Safety,Control Strategies for Pursuit-Evasion under Occlusion Using Visibility and Safety Barrier Functions,"Zhou, Minnan;Shaikh, Mustafa;Chaubey, Vatsalya;Haggerty, Patrick;Koga, Shumon;Panagou, Dimitra;Atanasov, Nikolay","Keywords: Sensor-based Control, Vision-Based Navigation, Robot Safety","Abstract: This paper develops a control strategy for pursuit-evasion problems in environments with occlusions. We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements.",,,,,,
Robot Safety,Dynamic Gap: Safe Gap-Based Navigation in Dynamic Environments,"Asselmeier, Maxwell;Ahuja, Dhruv;Zaro, Abdel;Abuaish, Ahmad;Zhao, Ye;Vela, Patricio","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Motion and Path Planning, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: This paper extends the family of gap-based local planners to unknown dynamic environments through generating provably collision-free properties for hierarchical navigation systems. Existing perception-informed local planners that operate in dynamic environments rely on emergent or empirical robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of dynamic obstacles. In addition to this, the obstacle tracking that is performed in these existent planners is often achieved with respect to a global inertial frame, subjecting such tracking estimates to transformation errors from odometry drift. The proposed local planner, dynamic gap, shifts the tracking paradigm to modeling how the free space, represented as gaps, evolves over time. Gap crossing and closing conditions are developed to aid in determining the feasibility of passage through gaps, and a breadth of simulation benchmarking is performed against other navigation planners in the literature where the proposed dynamic gap planner achieves the highest success rate out of all planners tested in all environments.",,,,,,
Robot Safety,Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance with Spheres,"Kwon, Yong Seok;Michaux, Jonathan;Isaacson, Seth;Zhang, Bohao;Ejakov, Matthew;Skinner, Katherine;Vasudevan, Ram","Keywords: Robot Safety, Planning under Uncertainty, Constrained Motion Planning","Abstract: Safe motion planning algorithms are necessary for deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments. Motion plans must be safe to ensure that the robot does not harm humans or damage any nearby objects. Generating these motion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt to sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods introduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially increasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon trajectory planner that generates probablistically-safe motion plans. Offline, CROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a sphere-based reachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion. CROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that provides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At runtime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is probabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free. We demonstrate that CROWS outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods in solving challenging motion planning tasks in cluttered environments while remaining collision-free.

To reason about the impact of a perception failure on the entire system performance, such task-relevant algorithms must contend with various challenges: complexity of AV stacks, high uncertainty in the operating environments, and the need for real-time performance. To overcome these challenges, in this work, we introduce a Q-network called SPARQ (abbreviation for Safety evaluation for Perception And Recovery Q-network) that evaluates the safety of a plan generated by a planning algorithm, accounting for perception failures that the planning process may have overlooked. This Q-network can be queried during system runtime to assess whether a proposed plan is safe for execution or poses potential safety risks. If a violation is detected, the network can then recommend a corrective plan while accounting for the perceptual failure. We validate our algorithm using the NuPlan-Vegas dataset, demonstrating its ability to handle cases where a perception failure compromises a proposed plan, while the corrective plan remains safe. We observe an overall accuracy and recall of 90% while sustaining a frequency of 42HZ on the unseen testing dataset. We compare our performance to a popular reachability based baseline and analysed some interesting properties of our approach in improving the safety properties of an AV pipeline.",,,,,,

Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we analyze several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of training RL with safety filters, featuring simulated and real-world experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. We examine how various training modifications and hyperparameters impact performance, sample efficiency, safety, and chattering. Our findings serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers focused on safety filters and safe RL.",,,,,,

These systems are particularly advantageous when metal or electronic components are impractical or when there are constraints on the control system volume or weight. This paper introduces a novel individual membrane valve that functions as a set-reset latch and can reduce the number of valves required for some pneumatic or microfluidic logic systems. An application of pneumatic logic systems in soft robotics is the access to multiple tethered pneumatic elements through a reduced number of pneumatic lines. To this end, this paper proposes two pneumatic logic systems capable of selecting among multiple distributed sets of pneumatic elements and operating the elements of the set simultaneously and independently through the different pneumatic lines. The selection is achieved via a sequence of pressure pulses applied on the same lines used afterwards for operation. Two prototypes of these pneumatic logic systems were built and successfully demonstrated, consisting primarily of set-reset membrane valves and powered by binary high/low pressure sources. The first prototype features a hierarchical network with four lines and five sets of three pneumatic elements each; the second prototype features a non-hierarchical network with five lines and twelve sets of four pneumatic elements each.",,,,,,

Traditional methods, such as portable ventilation equipment, are difficult to use when hazardous gases are released in inaccessible environments. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism that integrates an inflatable helical structure into a soft growing robot. The proposed mechanism is capable of performing suction through its inner channel after navigating complex environments, while maintaining the inherent advantages of the soft growing robot as it grows. The mechanism operates in two phases: a growing phase, in which the robot extends by eversion, and a suction phase, in which suction is performed through the inner channel of the robot. Experiments and demonstrations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. The experimental results confirmed the ability to maintain the passageway shape of the inner channel during suction operations and provided a design guideline. The demonstration validated that the mechanism can effectively navigate inaccessible environments and perform suction to remove hazardous gases.",,,,,,

We propose MetaMorph, a programmable robotic reflector attached to base stations that enhances signal quality from client devices by enhancing received signal energy with controlled reflections. We investigate the design of the reflector, and our experiments show the ability to improve the signal quality for LP-WAN(LoRa) communication systems demonstrating signal quality and battery-benefits.

Unlike current self-folding systems, which often lack re-programmability or lose rigidity after folding, MORF generates stiff structures over multiple folding cycles without degradation in performance. The ability to reconfigure and maintain structural stability is crucial for tasks such as reconfigurable tooling. The system utilizes a thermoplastic layer sandwiched within a thin magnetically responsive laminate sheet, enabling structures to self-fold in response to a combination of external magnetic field and heating. We demonstrate that the resulting folded structures can bear loads over 40 times their own weight and can undergo up to 50 cycles of repeated transformations without losing structural integrity. We showcase these strengths in a reconfigurable tool for unscrewing and screwing bolts and screws of various sizes, allowing the tool to adapt its shape to different bolt sizes while withstanding the mechanical stresses involved. This capability highlights the systemÂ’s potential for task-varying, load-bearing applications in robotics, where both versatility and durability are essential.",,,,,,

By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions.

The spatial features consist of the backbone curve and contour features. The backbone curve is represented by the piecewise BÃ©zier curve under geometrically continuous constraint. The contour features are extracted from the camera-generated point cloud. Besides, an adaptive online learning based shape controller (OLSC) is designed by online back-propagating shape error.

By considering human and UAS as co-workers, we use Petri Nets to abstractly model evolution of shared tasks assigned to human and UAS co-workers. Particularly, the Petri NetsÂ’ Â“placesÂ” represent work stations; therefore, the Petri NetsÂ’ transitions can formally specify displacements between the work stations. The paperÂ’s first objective is to incorporate uncertainty regarding the intentions of human co-workers into motion planning for UAS, when UAS closely interacts with human co-workers. To this end, the proposed Petri Nets model uses Â“conflictÂ” constructs to represent situations at which UAS deals with incomplete knowledge about human co-worker intention. The paperÂ’s second objective is then to plan the motion of the UAS in a resilient and safe manner, in the presence of non-cooperative human co-workers. In order to achieve this objective, UAS equipped with onboard perception and decision-making capabilities are able to, through real-time processing of in-situ observation, predict human intention, quantify human distraction, and apply a non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to safely plan UAS motion in the presence of uncertainty.

In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem faster than through centralized optimization at scale. We formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines.",,,,,,

However, when operating across the air and water, such as grasping marine products from the water, the visual information collected by the camera will be disturbed by ripples and bubbles on the water surface, resulting in low grasping efficiency. Therefore, we introduce a grasping strategy based on single-visual mapping for multi-step (SVMMS) operations, which is suitable for cross-medium operations involving stacked objects. Specifically, we design a multifunctional integrated network model based on Deep Q-learning, which extracts visual features from the scene to detect stacked objects and outputs their hierarchical relationships effectively. Moreover, we quantify the potential relationship between motion logic during action execution and changes in RGB-D information to help the robot achieve efficient and collision-free operations. Our approach also incorporates a time-series design with prioritized experience replay to optimize the action sequence globally. Additionally, we propose a novel sim2real method by combining domain randomization to address the difference in object sizes between the simulation and the real world. Extensive experiments in both simulation and physical environments show that SVMMS-Grasp significantly outperforms existing methods regarding task success rate, stability, and operational efficiency.",,,,,,
"Planning, Scheduling and Coordination",Efficient Second-Order Cone Programming for the Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem,"Gutow, Geordan;Choset, Howie","Keywords: Planning, Scheduling and Coordination, Optimization and Optimal Control, Motion and Path Planning","Abstract: When agents must execute multiple tasks at spatially distinct locations, it is common to formulate and solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the order of locations (targets) that requires the smallest travel cost. Approaching such task sequencing problems as a TSP is restrictive, as it requires that unique locations be specified for each task. In reality a set of acceptable locations might be available. The Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem in which the agent needs only visit a spherical neighborhood surrounding each target, and can thus address this task sequencing problem when any location in a sphere is acceptable. Prior work has developed a branch-and-bound approach that finds globally optimal solutions to instances of the CETSP by solving a sequence of Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP). We demonstrate it is possible to eliminate 2/3 of the variables and 1/2 of the constraints in these SOCPs, show how to reuse computation and memory allocation across multiple SOCPs in the sequence, and propose a strategy to warm-start the SOCPs using solutions obtained earlier in the sequence. Collectively, these three changes halve the time required to solve 210 random CETSP instances to optimality. We also obtained improved lower bounds on 73 instances from the literature, including solving one instance to optimality for the first time.",,,,,,

However, dynamic TSP (DTSP), with the random appearance of new customers over time, introduces additional complexities that challenge DRL methods by the difficulty of obtaining optimized routing policy which lead to sub-optimal results and reduced training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a decoupled training neural solver (DTNS) based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a novel approach that decouples the optimization of encoder and decoder, enhancing the model's ability to handle dynamic changes. Our method involves training under an Fore-Reveal condition first where the information of all customers nodes are known in advance to obtain optimized encoder and initialization for decoder and then fine-tuning the decoder in dynamic scenarios where dynamic customers are revealed over time. This training paradigm results in a flexible and globally optimized routing policy. Experimental results demonstrate that DTNS efficiently adapts to new customer requests in dynamic scenario, outperforming existing methods in dynamic routing environments.",,,,,,

But the majority of existing literature restricts drone launch and retrieve operations (LARO) to stationary truck, and potential drone route collisions are mostly ignored. This leads to inability to fully exploit the capability of drones. We address these gaps and introduce a new variant of multi-drone-truck collaborative delivery. However, the scheduling for drones and truck faces high-dimensional solution space and complex constraints, making it almost impossible for centralized solving. To this end, we develop a hierarchical solution framework that decomposes the complete problem into two levels of subproblem.

Deploying unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) as mobile recharging stations offers a practical solution, extending UAVsÂ’ operational range. This introduces the challenge of optimizing UAV-UGV routes for efficient mission point coverage and seamless recharging coordination. In this paper, we present a risk-aware deep reinforcement learning (Ra-DRL) framework with a multi-head attention mechanism within an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to solve this cooperative routing problem for a UAV-UGV team. Our model minimizes mission time while accounting for the stochastic fuel consumption of the UAV, influenced by environmental factors like wind velocity, ensuring adherence to a risk threshold to avoid mid-mission energy depletion. Extensive evaluations on various problem sizes show that our method significantly outperforms nearest-neighbor heuristics in both solution quality and risk management.

While cameras and LiDARs are commonly used to estimate the ego-motion of a vehicle, these sensors face limitations under bad lighting and severe weather conditions. Automotive radars overcome these challenges, but radar point clouds are generally sparse and noisy, making it difficult to identify useful features within a radar scan. In this paper, we address the problem of ego-motion estimation using a single automotive radar sensor. We propose a simple, yet effective, heuristic-based method to extract the ground plane from single radar scans and perform ground plane matching between consecutive scans. Additionally, we perform a windowed factor-graph optimization of the poses together with the ground plane, improving the accuracy of the pose estimation. We put our work to the test using the 4DRadarDataset.

However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry.

RADAR-Based Navigation,Ground-Optimized 4D Radar-Inertial Odometry Via Continuous Velocity Integration Using Gaussian Process,"Yang, Wooseong;Jang, Hyesu;Kim, Ayoung","Keywords: Range Sensing, SLAM, Localization","Abstract: Radar ensures robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions, yet challenges remain due to its high inherent noise level. Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements. Our approach demonstrates remarkable performance (less than 1% vertical drift) in public datasets with meticulous conditions, illustrating substantial improvement in elevation accuracy.

Radar's longer wavelength is less affected by small particulates, providing operational advantages in challenging environments such as dust, smoke, and fog. This paper presents Radar Teach and Repeat (RT&R): a full-stack radar system for long-term off-road robot autonomy. RT&R can drive routes reliably in off-road cluttered areas without any GPS. We benchmark the radar system's closed-loop path-tracking performance and compare it to its 3D LiDAR counterpart. 11.8 km of autonomous driving was completed without interventions using only radar and gyro for navigation. RT&R was evaluated on four different routes with progressively less structured scene geometry. RT&R achieved lateral path-tracking root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 5.6 cm, 7.5 cm, and 12.1 cm as the routes became more challenging. These RMSE values are less than half of the width of one tire (24 cm) on our robot testing platform. These same routes have worst-case errors of 21.7 cm, 24.0 cm, and 43.8 cm. We conclude that radar is a viable alternative to LiDAR for long-term autonomy in challenging off-road scenarios.

However, its standalone application for depth perception is constrained by issues of sparsity and noise. Radar-camera depth estimation offers a more promising complementary solution. Despite significant progress, current approaches fail to produce satisfactory dense depth maps, due to the unsatisfactory processing of the sparse and noisy radar data. They constrain the regions of interest for radar points in rigid rectangular regions, which may introduce unexpected errors and confusions. To address these issues, we develop a structure-aware strategy for radar depth enhancement, which provides more targeted regions of interest by leveraging the structural priors of RGB images. Furthermore, we design a Multi-Scale Structure Guided Network to enhance radar features and preserve detailed structures, achieving accurate and structure-detailed dense metric depth estimation.

Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a slidingÂ–window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments.

Without prior information, the exploration performance is usually conservative due to the limited planning horizon. This paper exploits a prior topo-metric graph of the environment to benefit both the exploration efficiency and the pose graph reliability in SLAM. Based on the relationship between pose graph reliability and graph topology, we formulate a SLAM-aware path planning problem over the prior graph, which finds a fast exploration path enhanced with the globally informative loop-closing actions to stabilize the SLAM pose graph. A greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, in which we derive theoretical thresholds that significantly prune non-optimal loop-closing actions without affecting the potential informative ones. Furthermore, we incorporate the proposed planner into a hierarchical exploration framework, with flexible features including path replanning, and online prior graph update that adds additional information to the prior graph. Simulation and real-world experiments indicate that the proposed method can reliably achieve higher mapping accuracy than compared methods when exploring environments with rich topologies, while maintaining comparable exploration efficiency.

Autonomous operation is crucial in these scenarios to reduce reliance on human operators and enable real-time decision-making. However, robots must balance multiple, often conflicting, objectives. These objectives are subject to change based on new data or evolving conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic multi-objective trajectory planning.

To address this issue, in this work, we propose a hierarchical planning method based on region partitioning. The space is dynamically partitioned at a coarse resolution, and as exploration progresses, regions with sufficient known areas are further subdivided to locate unknown areas more precisely. A utility function considering unknown area size, travel distance, and sequence similarity is used, and the simulated annealing algorithm generates a subregion sequence for global guidance. Within each subregion, a linear acceleration model helps select target points. This method reduces computational load and minimizes long-distance backtracking, enabling more efficient high-frequency planning.

In this work, we focus on structured indoor environments, which often exhibit predictable, repeating patterns. Conventional frontier-based exploration approaches have difficulty leveraging this predictability, relying on simple heuristics such as 'closest first' for exploration. More recent deep learning-based methods predict unknown regions of the map for information gain computation, but these approaches are often sensitive to the predicted map quality or fail to account for sensor coverage. To overcome these issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments on the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than representative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than nearest frontier approach.

Active Sensing,Ergodic Trajectory Optimization on Generalized Domains Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy,"Hughes, Christian;Warren, Houston;Lee, Darrick;Ramos, Fabio;Abraham, Ian","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Integrated Planning and Control","Abstract: We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain",,,,,,

A popular approach to trajectory planning for these types of missions is ergodic search, which biases a trajectory to spend time in parts of the exploration domain that are believed to contain more information. Most prior work on ergodic search has been limited to searching simple surfaces, like a 2D Euclidean plane or a sphere, as they rely on projecting functions defined on the exploration domain onto analytically obtained Fourier basis functions. In this paper, we extend ergodic search to any surface that can be approximated by a triangle mesh. The basis functions are approximated through finite element methods on a triangle mesh of the domain. We formally prove that this approximation converges to the continuous case as the mesh approximation converges to the true domain. We demonstrate that on domains where analytical basis functions are available (plane, sphere), the proposed method obtains equivalent results, and while on other domains (torus, bunny, wind turbine), the approach is versatile enough to still search effectively. Lastly, we also compare with an existing ergodic search technique that can handle complex domains and show that our method results in a higher quality exploration.",,,,,,

Be sides environmental challenges, labor shortage also poses crucial challenges to the agricultural production system. Automation of manual tasks in crop production can potentially increase efficiency but also lead to a change in agricultural practices for more effective usage of available land. In this paper, we address the problem of robotic fruit harvesting in challenging real-world scenarios such as vertical farms, where robotic sensing and acting need to cope with a cluttered environment. Robotic fruit harvesting is typically done by directly detecting a grasp point in the sensor reading, which can lie on the fruit itself or on its peduncle depending on crop harvesting requirements. However, grasp point detection is not always possible as the ideal grasp point may be hidden behind leaves or other fruits. Our approach exploits shape completion techniques allowing us to estimate the complete 3D shape of a target fruit together with its pose even under strong occlusions. In this way, we can estimate a grasp point even when the fruit is only partially visible. We evaluate our approach on a real robotic manipulator operating in a vertical farm growing different fruit species and employing different harvesting tools. Our experiments show that, on average, our proposed pipeline increases the success rate by 18.5 percentage points, in terms of end-effector positioning, compared to the most competitive baseline among the ones reported in this work, that does not rely on shape completion.",,,,,,

To this end, we describe a Push-Traversability graph, whose vertices represent poses that the pusher can push objects from and edges represent optimal, kinematically feasible, and stable push-rearrangements of objects. Based on this graph, we develop ReloPush, a planning framework that leverages Dubins curves and standard graph search techniques to generate an efficient sequence of object rearrangements to be executed by the pusher. We evaluate ReloPush across a series of challenging scenarios, involving the rearrangement of densely cluttered workspaces with up to eight objects by a 1tenth mobile robot pusher. ReloPush exhibits orders of magnitude faster runtimes and significantly more robust execution in the real world, evidenced in lower execution times and fewer losses of object contact, compared to two baselines lacking our proposed graph structure.",,,,,,
Manipulation Planning and Control 2,Non-Prehensile Shape Manipulation of Elastoplastic Objects with Reinforcement Learning,"Herland, Sverre;Misimi, Ekrem","Keywords: Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: We present a novel framework for non-prehensile shape manipulation of deformable objects using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Unlike previous approaches that rely on grasping, our method employs a sequence of gentle pushing actions to deform objects into target shapes. We introduce a continuous parametrization of pushing actions that allows for precise control over pushing trajectories, enabling more flexible and efficient manipulation. The framework is applicable to a wide range of objects by representing them as sampled boundary coordinates, removing the need for predefined object partitions. Trained entirely in simulation, our controller demonstrates zero-shot transfer to real-world scenarios without additional training. Extensive evaluations show that our approach not only matches but substantially exceeds the performance of previous methods, while being more gentle and efficient. We demonstrate successful manipulation across various deformable objects and materials, including food items like salmon and pork loin. This work represents a significant advancement in robotic manipulation of deformable objects, with potential applications in food processing, manufacturing, and beyond.",,,,,,
Manipulation Planning and Control 2,ORLA*: Mobile Manipulator-Based Object Rearrangement with Lazy A*,"Gao, Kai;Zhaxizhuoma, Zhaxizhuoma;Ding, Yan;Zhang, Shiqi;Yu, Jingjin","Keywords: Mobile Manipulation, Task Planning, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: Effectively performing object rearrangement is an essential skill for mobile manipulators, e.g., setting up a dinner table. A key challenge in such problems is deciding an appropriate ordering to effectively untangle object-object dependencies while considering the necessary motions for realizing manipulation tasks (e.g., pick and place). Computing time-optimal multi-object rearrangement solutions for mobile manipulators remains a largely untapped research direction. In this work, we propose ORLA*, which leverages delayed/lazy evaluation in searching for a high-quality object pick-n-place sequence that considers both end-effector and mobile robot base travel. ORLA* readily handles multi-layered rearrangement tasks powered by learning-based stability predictions. Employing an optimal solver for finding temporary locations for displacing objects, ORLA* can achieve global optimality. Through extensive simulation and ablation study, we confirm the effectiveness of ORLA* delivering quality solutions for challenging rearrangement instances.

Imitation Learning for Manipulation 1,Learning Prehensile Dexterity by Imitating and Emulating State-Only Observations,"Han, Yunhai;Chen, Zhenyang;Williams, Kyle;Ravichandar, Harish","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Dexterous Manipulation","Abstract: When human acquire physical skills (e.g., tennis) from experts, we tend to first learn from merely observing the expert. But this is often insufficient. We then engage in practice, where we try to emulate the expert and ensure that our actions produce similar effects on our environment. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Combining IMitation and Emulation for Motion Refinement (CIMER) -- a two-stage framework to learn dexterous prehensile manipulation skills from state-only observations. CIMER's first stage involves imitation: simultaneously encode the complex interdependent motions of the robot hand and the object in a structured dynamical system. This results in a reactive motion generation policy that provides a reasonable motion prior, but lacks the ability to reason about contact effects due to the lack of action labels. The second stage involves emulation: learn a motion refinement policy via reinforcement that adjusts the robot hand's motion prior such that the desired object motion is reenacted. CIMER is both task-agnostic (no task-specific reward design or shaping) and intervention-free (no additional teleoperated or labeled demonstrations). Detailed experiments with prehensile dexterity reveal that i) imitation alone is insufficient, but adding emulation drastically improves performance, ii) CIMER outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency and the ability to generate realistic and stable motions, iii) CIMER can either zero-shot generalize or learn to adapt to novel objects from the YCB dataset, even outperforming expert policies trained with action labels in most cases.

We present EgoMimic, a full-stack framework that scales manipulation through egocentric-view human demonstrations. EgoMimic achieves this through: (1) an ergonomic human data collection system using the Project Aria glasses, (2) a low-cost bimanual manipulator that minimizes the kinematic gap to human data, (3) cross-domain data alignment techniques, and (4) an imitation learning architecture that co-trains on hand and robot data. Compared to prior works that only extract high-level intent from human videos, our approach treats human and robot data equally as embodied demonstration data and learns a unified policy from both data sources. EgoMimic achieves significant improvement on a diverse set of long-horizon, single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art imitation learning methods and enables generalization to entirely new scenes. Finally, we show a favorable scaling trend for EgoMimic, where adding 1 hour of additional hand data is significantly more valuable than 1 hour of additional robot data.

Imitation Learning for Manipulation 1,Neural Dynamics Augmented Diffusion Policy,"Wu, Ruihai;Chen, Haozhe;Zhang, Mingtong;Lu, Haoran;Li, Yitong;Li, Yunzhu","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Model Learning for Control, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Imitation learning has been proven effective in mimicking demonstrations across various robotic manipulation tasks. However, to develop robust policies, current imitation methods, such as diffusion policy, require training on extensive demonstrations, making data collection labor-intensive. In contrast, model-based planning with dynamics models can effectively cover a sufficient range of configurations using only off-policy data. Yet, without the guidance of expert demonstrations, many tasks are difficult and time-consuming to plan using the dynamics models. Therefore, we take the best of both model learning and imitation learning, and propose neural dynamics augmented imitation learning that covers a large scene configurations with few-shot demonstrations. This method trains a robust diffusion policy in a local support region using few-shot demonstrations and rearranges objects outside this region into it using offline-trained neural dynamics models. Extensive experiments across various tasks in both simulations and real-world scenarios, including granular manipulation, contact-rich task and multi-object interaction task, have demonstrated that trained with only 1 to 30 demonstrations, our proposed method can robustly cover a significantly larger area than the policy trained purely from the demonstrations.

This paper introduces CAGE, a novel robotic manipulation policy designed to overcome these generalization barriers by integrating the pre-trained visual representation with causal attention mechanism. CAGE utilizes the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the vision foundation model DINOv2, combined with LoRA fine-tuning for robust environment understanding. The policy further employs a causal perceiver for effective token compression and a diffusion-based action head with attention to enhance task-specific fine-grained conditioning. With as few as 50 demonstrations from a single training environment, CAGE achieves robust generalization across diverse visual changes in objects, backgrounds, and viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate that CAGE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art RGB/RGB-D-based approaches in various manipulation tasks, especially under large distribution shifts. In similar environments, CAGE offers an average of 42% increase in task completion rate.

We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of invariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance data augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by modifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting the policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying rigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions to generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive experiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in policy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust generalization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of distractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping, indicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task dynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA provides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning, bridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.

Imitation Learning for Manipulation 1,Conditional Neural Expert Processes for Learning Movement Primitives from Demonstration,"Yildirim, Yigit;Ugur, Emre","Keywords: Learning from Demonstration, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a widely used technique for skill acquisition in robotics. However, demonstrations of the same skill may exhibit significant variances, or learning systems may attempt to acquire different means of the same skill simultaneously, making it challenging to encode these motions into movement primitives. To address these challenges, we propose an LfD framework, namely the Conditional Neural Expert Processes (CNEP), that learns to assign demonstrations from different modes to distinct expert networks utilizing the inherent information within the latent space to match experts with the encoded representations. CNEP does not require supervision on which mode the trajectories belong to. We compare the performance of CNEP against widely used and powerful LfD methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models, Probabilistic Movement Primitives, and Stable Movement Primitives and show that our method outperforms these baselines on multimodal trajectory datasets. The results reveal enhanced modeling performance for movement primitives, leading to the synthesis of trajectories that more accurately reflect those demonstrated by experts, particularly when the skill demonstrations include intersection points from various trajectories. We evaluated the CNEP model on two real-robot tasks, namely obstacle avoidance and pick-and-place tasks, that require the robot to learn multi-modal motion trajectories and execute the correct primitives given target environment conditions. We also showed that our system is capable of on-the-fly adaptation to environmental changes via an online conditioning mechanism. Lastly, we believe that CNEP offers improved explainability and interpretability by autonomously finding discrete behavior primitives and providing probability values about its expert selection decisions.",,,,,,

Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.",,,,,,

Additionally, robotic systems are typically assumed to follow basic rigid-body dynamics. However, several examples in nature illustrate how changes in physical material properties yield functional advantages. In this paper, we explore how physical materials (non-rigid bodies) affect the functional performance of a hopping robot. In doing so, we address the practical question of how to model and simulate material properties. Through these simulations we demonstrate that material gradients in the leg of a single-limb hopper provide functional advantages compared to homogeneous designs. For example, when considering incline ramp hopping, a material gradient with increasing density provides a 35% reduction in tracking error and a 23% reduction in power consumption compared to homogeneous stainless steel.
By providing bio-inspiration to the rigid limbs in a robotic system, we seek to show that future fabrication of robots should look to leverage the material anisotropies of moduli and density found in nature. This would allow for reduced vibrations in the system and would provide offsets of joint torques and vibrations while protecting their structural integrity against reduced fatigue and wear. This simulation system could inspire future intelligent material gradients of custom-fabricated robotic locomotive devices.",,,,,,
Bio-Inspired Robot Learning,SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency Using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning,"Joshi, Amogh;Kosta, Adarsh Kumar;Roy, Kaushik","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Bioinspired Robot Learning, Probabilistic Inference","Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25âˆ?8% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.",,,,,,

We present a neurorobotic navigation system that utilizes a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Wavefront Planner and E-prop learning to concurrently map and plan paths in a large and complex environment. We incorporate a novel method for mapping which, when combined with the Spiking Wavefront Planner (SWP), allows for adaptive planning by selectively considering any combination of costs. The system is tested on a mobile robot platform in an outdoor environment with obstacles and varying terrain. Results indicate that the system is capable of discerning features in the environment using three measures of cost, (1) energy expenditure by the wheels, (2) time spent in the presence of obstacles, and (3) terrain slope. In just twelve hours of online training, E-prop learns and incorporates traversal costs into the path planning maps by updating the delays in the SWP. On simulated paths, the SWP plans significantly shorter and lower cost paths than A* and RRT*. The SWP is compatible with neuromorphic hardware and could be used for applications requiring low size, weight, and power.",,,,,,

However, they still face mobility challenges including steep slopes and unstable soil that can entrap vehicles, as demonstrated by NASAÂ’s Spirit rover. Vehicles on Earth can depend on a human operator or rescue vehicle to tow them out of an entrapment, but remote rovers cannot, limiting their route to highly conservative path selections. To increase rover mobility on slopes and unstable soils, we present a resettable anchor launcher for independent self-rescue. The device launches a tethered land anchor away from the rover and then uses a winch to tow the rover up a hill or out of an entrapment. This paper presents the design of the launcher and its integration into a half-meter-long rover mobility platform with field testing at the NASA Glenn Research Center SLOPE Lab. We demonstrate repeatable launching and winching to help the rover climb a 17Â° slope of loose GRC-1 Lunar regolith simulant that it otherwise could not climb.

Robotic assembly is critical to reduce required crew time and risk, while modularity ensures that solutions are versatile and adaptive to complex mission concepts. NASAÂ’s Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) project demonstrated that robots with relatively low cost, size, and degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) can be used for large-scale modular lattice structure assembly. This is possible by using the structural modules for robotic systems metrology and error mitigation. Robots with reduced complexity may lead to advantages in initial and maintenance cost, offering an alternative to large, complex, and expensive robots. In this paper, we describe the Structure Omni-directional Foldable Explorer (SOF-E), a robot with significantly lower mass and DoF compared to the previous ARMADAS robot architecture. Although SOF-E is a five DoF robot with only two or three control states per actuator, it is capable of transporting and placing structural modules by collaborating with other instances of itself. We discuss the mechanical design and architecture of SOF-E, including analysis of energy usage during each operation. Experiments demonstrate that during locomotion and module transport tasks, SOF-E requires significantly lower energy than the previous cargo transport robot architecture, the Scaling Omni-directional Lattice Locomoting Explorer (SOLL-E).

Quarry-Bot autonomously clears debris on the lunar surface, a key step in site preparation for future habitats and infrastructure. The system utilizes active control strategies, combined with the MoonÂ’s lower gravity, to perform underhand rock tosses as a scalable approach to extraterrestrial site preparation. Its reconfigurable structure, including motorized anchor points and a lightweight tripod design, adjusts cable tensions to generate swing motions for debris displacement.

Space Robotics 1,A Tugging Controller That Maximizes Lateral Resistive Force by Mounding Sandy Terrain,"Moon, Deaho;Huang, Chris;Page, Justin;Stuart, Hannah","Keywords: Space Robotics and Automation, Field Robots, Sensor-based Control","Abstract: Sandy environments present challenges for robotic space rovers and systems due to reduced traction, limiting mobility and tugging force. This paper presents an anchoring method that utilizes a winching system to create a sand mound in front of a mobile agent dragged through the media. The proposed controller is designed to consistently achieve real-time capture of close-to-maximal lateral sand mound resistive force, even when applied to varied uneven terrains, like holes or waves. Notably, tugging is non-reversible, so suitable peaks should be captured before breakdown and without necessarily knowing the global optimum a priori. The controller logic tracks both tugging force and agent pitch gradients to detect terrain conditions and peak force trends. Results show that the controller captures an average 92% of the maximum forces, within the previously winched workspace tested, across three different granular media with four varying structured terrain features. The controller achieves higher resistive force peaks on terrains with geometric features, as opposed to flat sand. We conclude that sand mounding through tugging is a viable means to generate robotic resistive forces for unknown sandy terrains, a simple yet effective anchoring mechanism.",,,,,,

A key area limiting the adaptation of RL in the real world is the lack of trust in the decision-making process of such policies. Therefore, explainability is a requirement of any RL agent operating in the real world. In this work, we propose a family of control policies that are explainable-by-design regarding individual observation components on object-based scene representations. By estimating diagonal squashed Gaussian and categorical mixture distributions on sub-spaces of the decomposed observations, we develop stochastic policies with easy-to-read explanations of the decision-making process. Our design is generally applicable to any RL algorithm using stochastic policies. We showcase the explainability on an extensive suite of single- and multi-agent simulations, set- and sequence-based high-level scenes, and discrete and continuous action spaces, with performance at least on-par or better compared to standard policy architectures.

For the most common depth cameras and LiDAR sensors, the distinctive optical attributes inherent in both transparent and reflective objects pose a significant challenge. To address this problem, this study proposes a lightweight joint boundary detection and semantic segmentation network named LBSNet. LBSNet aims to enhance the perception of transparent and reflective objects in complex and dynamic environments, using RGB images only. It leverages the synergy between boundary detection and semantic segmentation through feature fusion and a multitask learning mechanism. The encoder consists of two paths: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The gated channel adaptive (GCA) module enhances boundary features by learning channel parameters. The dynamic adaptive feature fusion (DAFF) module dynamically adjusts semantic and boundary information through cross-feature fusion. These methods effectively capture the distinctive characteristics of transparent and reflective objects, such as light refraction, boundary blurring and low contrast.

The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired keyframes from the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV's visual experience.

Aerial Robots: Learning 2,Learning to Fly in Seconds,"Eschmann, Jonas;Albani, Dario;Loianno, Giuseppe","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Applications, Machine Learning for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Learning-based methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), hold great promise for streamlining deployment, enhancing performance, and achieving generalization in the control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles. Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU. The fast training times and deployment to a cheap, off-the-shelf quadrotor lower the barriers to entry and help democratize the research and development of these systems.",,,,,,

Traditional manual inspections face significant challenges in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Given the significant challenges in automatically detecting defects of varying intensity and size within complex infrastructure, along with the tendency of lightweight models to lose detail and fail to fully capture features during the defect extraction process, we propose the CUPID_Block, a multi-level information fusion block to construct the backbone, featuring the CUPID_Conv module equipped with our proposed CCA (CrissCross Attention).

Aerial Robots: Learning 2,ProxFly: Robust Control for Close Proximity Quadcopter Flight Via Residual Reinforcement Learning,"Zhang, Ruiqi;Zhang, Dingqi;Mueller, Mark Wilfried","Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: This paper proposes the ProxFly, a residual deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller for close proximity quadcopter flight. Specifically, we design a residual module on top of a cascaded controller (denoted as basic controller) to generate high-level control commands, which compensate for external disturbances and thrust loss caused by downwash effects from other quadcopters. First, our method takes only the ego state and controllers' commands as inputs and does not rely on any communication between quadcopters, thereby reducing the bandwidth requirement. Through domain randomization, our method relaxes the requirement for accurate system identification and fine-tuned controller parameters, allowing it to adapt to changing system models. Meanwhile, our method not only reduces the proportion of unexplainable signals from the black box in control commands but also enables the RL training to skip the time-consuming exploration from scratch via guidance from the basic controller. We validate the effectiveness of the residual module in the simulation with different proximities. Moreover, we conduct the real close proximity flight test to compare ProxFly with the basic controller and an advanced model-based controller with complex aerodynamic compensation. Finally, we show that ProxFly can be used for challenging quadcopter mid-air docking, where two quadcopters fly in extreme proximity, and strong airflow significantly disrupts flight.

The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft.

Aerial Robots: Learning 2,Modular Reinforcement Learning for a Quadrotor UAV with Decoupled Yaw Control,"Yu, Beomyeol;Lee, Taeyoung","Keywords: Aerial Systems: Mechanics and Control, Reinforcement Learning, AI-Enabled Robotics","Abstract: This paper presents modular reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for the low-level control of a quadrotor, enabling direct control of yawing motion. While traditional monolithic RL approaches have demonstrated success in real-world autonomous flight, they often struggle to precisely control both the translational and yawing motions due to their distinct dynamic characteristics and strong coupling. Moreover, training a large-scale monolithic network typically demands a wealth of training data for broad generalization. To address these issues, we decompose the quadrotor dynamics into translational and yawing subsystems and assign dedicated modular RL agents for each. This design significantly improves performance, as each RL agent is trained for its specific purpose, and they are integrated in a synergistic way. It further enhances robustness, as potential failures within one module have minimal impact on the other, promoting fault tolerance. These improvements are illustrated by flight experiments achieved via zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. It is shown that the proposed modular policies substantially enhance training efficiency, tracking performance, and adaptability to real-world conditions.",,,,,,

In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)Â—a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 2,SPINE: Online Semantic Planning for Missions with Incomplete Natural Language Specifications in Unstructured Environments,"Ravichandran, Zachary;Murali, Varun;Tzes, Mariliza;Pappas, George J.;Kumar, Vijay","Keywords: AI-Enabled Robotics, Autonomous Agents, Field Robots","Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots infer the relevant details. Because pre-built maps are difficult to obtain in many realistic settings, accomplishing such missions will require the robot to map and plan online. While many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified missions such as object search or exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning abilities over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. However, existing LLM-enabled planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks and semantics are provided by a pre-built map or a user. We address these limitations via SPINE, an online planner for missions with incomplete mission specifications provided in natural language. The planner uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission specification and then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. Tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new map observations. We evaluate SPINE in simulation and real-world settings with missions that require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000 square meters. Compared to baselines that use existing LLM-enabled planning approaches, our method is over twice as efficient in terms of time and distance, requires less user interactions, and does not require a full map.

CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment.

Task planning under these constraints is essential for enabling autonomous robot operation in domains that require adherence to domain-specific knowledge. Current methods for generating robot goals and plans rely on common sense knowledge encoded in large language models. However, these models lack grounding of robot plans to domain-specific knowledge and are not easily transferable between multiple sites or customers with different compliance needs. In this work, we present SayComply, which enables grounding robotic task planning with operational compliance using retrieval-based language models. We design a hierarchical database of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and procedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the limited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a tree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot tasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the domain knowledge in the database. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in real-world scenarios that require precise context retrieval across various types of context, outperforming the standard RAG method.

To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM plannersÂ’ capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efï¬cient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high conï¬dence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation.

In order for multiple robots to perform tasks more efficiently, it is necessary to manage the precedence dependencies between tasks. Although multi-robot decentralized and centralized task planners using LLMs have been proposed, none of these studies focus on precedence dependencies from the perspective of task efficiency or leverage traditional optimization methods. It addresses key challenges in managing dependencies between skills and optimizing task allocation. LiP-LLM consists of three steps: skill list generation and dependency graph generation by LLMs, and task allocation using linear programming. The LLMs are utilized to generate a comprehensive list of skills and to construct a dependency graph that maps the relationships and sequential constraints among these skills. To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of skill execution, the skill list is generated by calculated likelihood, and linear programming is used to optimally allocate tasks to each robot. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing task planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in executing complex, multi-robot tasks. The results indicate the potential of combining LLMs with optimization techniques to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in executing coordinated tasks accurately and efficiently.

We pose this as an optimization problem with constraints and study two different formulations: (1) Fair coverage, where we minimize the maximum coverage cost for any field, promoting equitable resource distribution among all fields; and (2) Constrained coverage, where each field must be covered below a certain cost threshold, ensuring that critical areas receive adequate coverage according to predefined importance levels. We study the decentralized setting where robots have limited communication and local sensing capabilities, making the system more realistic, scalable, and robust. Given the complexity, we propose a novel decentralized constrained learning approach that combines primal-dual optimization with a Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) neural network architecture. We show that the Lagrangian of the dual problem can be reformulated as a linear combination of the IDFs, enabling the LPAC policy to serve as a primal solver.

In particular, cutaneous feedback devices provide intrinsic stability and reduced form factor compared to kinesthetic feedback interfaces. However, the implementation of cutaneous feedback devices in industrial settings must be rigorously validated to prevent potential equipment accidents, which could lead to substantial economic losses due to unskilled robot manipulation. This paper presents a novel ungrounded haptic control interface (POstick-VF), designed specifically for high-risk steel production tasks. POstick-VF offers visuo-tactile feedback within an extensive workspace, enabling intuitive robot manipulation through its kinematic similarity with real tools ensuring safety. The performance of the developed POstick is rigorously validated and compared with conventional joystick controller through experiments conducted with an on-site hydraulic robot.",,,,,,
Haptics 2,Enhanced Tiny Haptic Dial with T-Shaped Shaft Based on Magnetorheological Fluid,"Heo, Yong Hae;Kim, Seongho;Kim, Sang-Youn","Keywords: Haptics and Haptic Interfaces, Touch in HRI","Abstract: This paper introduces a tiny haptic dial utilizing magnetorheological fluid (MRF) to enhance its resistive torque feedback. Moreover, we design the T-shaped rotary shaft with bumps and embed it into the haptic dial to enhance its haptic performance (resistive torque). This structure enables two operation modes (shear and flow) of MRF that contribute to the actuation simultaneously in the proposed haptic dial. This structure allows the magnetic flux to flow towards the MRF, helping further maximize the resistive torque. We conduct a simulation to confirm that the magnetic flux generated from a solenoid forms a closed-loop magnetic path without magnetic saturation or leakage in the proposed haptic dial. The resistive torque of the proposed haptic dial varied from 8 NÂ·mm to 47 NÂ·mm as the input current changed from 0 to 300 mA, thus indicating that the proposed haptic dial can create a variety of haptic sensations in a tiny size (diameter: 20 mm; height:20 mm).",,,,,,

This article aims to combine the strengths of both entities within a singular task: human motion guidance under strict geometric constraints, particularly adhering to predetermined paths. To tackle this challenge, a modular haptic guidance law is proposed that takes the human-applied wrench as an input. Using an auxiliary variable called phase, the generated desired motion is guaranteed to consistently adhere to the constraint path. It is demonstrated how the guidance policy can be generalized into physically interpretable terms, adjustable either prior to initiating the task or dynamically while the task is in progress. Additionally, an illustrative guidance adaptation policy is showcased that takes into account the human's manipulability. Leveraging passivity analysis, potential sources of instability are pinpointed, and subsequently, overall system stability is ensured by incorporating an augmented virtual energy tank. Lastly, a comprehensive set of experiments, including a 20-participant user study, explores various aspects of the approach in practice, encompassing both technical and usability consideration.",,,,,,

In a previous work, we introduced the Wearable-Fabric Yielding Display (W-FYD), which uses an elastic thin fabric as the interaction surface with the finger, allowing the delivery of softness-related cues both in active and passive exploration mode, together with sliding stimuli. The device was proven effective, but the current design faces form factor issues related to the dimensions and weight of the device, due to the actuation strategy of the lifting mechanism in the passive mode. To tackle this issue, we propose a miniaturized version of the system, named the W-FYD AIR, which allows reducing the overall dimensions of the device, from 100 Ã— 60 Ã— 36 mm to 78 Ã— 45 Ã— 37 mm, and its weight, from 100 g to 54 g, by exploiting pneumatically-actuated chambers for the lifting mechanism.

Big Data,How Generalizable Is My Behavior Cloning Policy? a Statistical Approach to Trustworthy Performance Evaluation,"Vincent, Joseph;Nishimura, Haruki;Itkina, Masha;Shah, Paarth;Schwager, Mac;Kollar, Thomas","Keywords: Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking, Probability and Statistical Methods, AI-Enabled Robotics","Abstract: With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source.",,,,,,

Open-vocabulary detectors are proposed to locate and recognize objects in novel classes. However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation.
This paper introduces 3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of fine-grained captions and careful attention to fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect fine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.

However, curating, distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM reduces the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and data load time during training. In particular, compared to the RLDS format used in OXE datasets, Robo-DMÂ’s compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x (lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster. In fine-tuning Octo, a transformer-based robot policy with 73k episodes with RT-1 data, Robo-DM does not incur any loss in training performance.

Motion Prediction,TransFusion: A Practical and Effective Transformer-Based Diffusion Model for 3D Human Motion Prediction,"Tian, Sibo;Zheng, Minghui;Liang, Xiao","Keywords: Human-Robot Collaboration, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Computer Vision for Automation","Abstract: Predicting human motion plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and effective human-robot close collaboration in intelligent remanufacturing systems of the future. Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse predictions based on
observations. The former group fails to address the uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth or
become unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more practical and effective model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our human motion prediction model.

Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial. Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data. The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable representations of motion in human crowded scenes. Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person jointsÂ’ trajectory. After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks.

Traditional methods often rely on maintaining a significant distance between the robot and the human, which limits interaction and responsiveness. In contrast, close-proximity front-following facilitates immediate engagement, enhancing user experience and improving human-robot interaction. Nonetheless, it presents challenges in accurately interpreting human walking intentions due to a restricted observational field. In our paper, we introduce an innovative Depth-Temporal Attention Network that takes lower-limb depth images and robot motor signals as input, to accurately predict human walking intentions. This network leverages a depth attention module to capture essential spatial features and integrates a temporal attention mechanism to analyze movement dynamics. To enhance generalization, we use a domain adversarial module that focuses on shared features across diverse walking data, ensuring consistent performance across users. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive average intention prediction accuracy of 91.09%, significantly surpassing baseline models by 12.59% to 23.66%.

However, the original 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks color representation for inputs in lowlight environments. Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization.

Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named textbf{Elite-EvGS}. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel textit{warm-up initialization strategy} that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a textit{progressive event supervision strategy} that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes.

However, cable-driven manipulators face control difficulties due to hysteresis from cabling effects such as friction, elongation, and coupling. These effects are difficult to model due to nonlinearity and the difficulties become even more evident when dealing with long and coupled, multi-segmented manipulator. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture these nonlinear and previous states-dependent characteristics of cable actuation. We collect physical joint configurations according to command joint configurations using RGBD sensing and 7 fiducial markers to model the hysteresis of the proposed manipulator. Result on a study comparing the estimation performance of four DNN models show that the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) demonstrates the highest predictive capability. Leveraging trained TCNs, we build a control algorithm to compensate for hysteresis. Tracking tests in task space using unseen trajectories show that the proposed control algorithm reduces the average position and orientation error by 61.39% (from 13.7mm to 5.29 mm) and 64.04% (from 31.17Â° to 11.21Â°), respectively.

This unified framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the frameworkÂ’s robust performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end, Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.",,,,,,
Continuum Robots 2,On the Benefits of Hysteresis in Tendon Driven Continuum Robots,"Hanley, David;Alambeigi, Farshid;Khadem, Mohsen","Keywords: Soft Robot Materials and Design, Modeling, Control, and Learning for Soft Robots, Surgical Robotics: Steerable Catheters/Needles","Abstract: Hysteresis in the tendons driving continuum robots is frequently regarded as a nuisance and a problem that is best avoided. Some prior work seeks to ameliorate the effects of hysteresis through the selection of materials. Others propose models of hysteresis to compensate for their effects. In this work, we present an empirically validated model of hysteresis in tendon-driven continuum robots. We demonstrate that hysteresis contributes to the stability of these robots by mitigating undesirable tensions in robot's backbone. As a result, a model-based approach to hysteresis can be used not just for compensation of a nuisance, but to enhance the utility of continuum robots in safety critical applications such as medical robots.",,,,,,

The neural network takes as input these measurements and produces as output a finite-dimensional approximation of the strain, which is further used to reconstruct the infinite-dimensional smooth posture. This problem is important for various soft robotic applications. It is challenging due to the flexible aspects that lead to the infinite-dimensional reconstruction problem for the continuous posture and strains.

In this paper, we introduce GraspSAM, an innovative extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) designed for prompt-driven and category-agnostic grasp detection. Unlike previous methods, which are often limited by small-scale training data, GraspSAM leverages SAMÂ’s large-scale training and prompt-based segmentation capabilities to efficiently support both target-object and category-agnostic grasping. By utilizing adapters, learnable token embeddings, and a lightweight modified decoder, GraspSAM requires minimal fine-tuning to integrate object segmentation and grasp prediction into a unified framework.

Existing methods either rely on costly manual TOG annotations or only extract coarse grasping positions or regions from human demonstrations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce RTAGrasp, a Retrieval, Transfer, and Alignment framework inspired by human grasping strategies. Specifically, our approach first effortlessly constructs a robot memory from human grasping demonstration videos, extracting both TOG position and direction constraints. Then, given a task instruction and a visual observation of the target object, RTAGrasp retrieves the most similar human grasping experience from its memory and leverages semantic matching capabilities of vision foundation models to transfer the TOG constraints to the target object in a training-free manner. Finally, RTAGrasp aligns the transferred TOG constraints with the robot's action for execution. Evaluations on the public TOG benchmark, TaskGrasp dataset, show the competitive performance of RTAGrasp on both seen and unseen object categories compared to existing baseline methods. Real-world experiments further validate its effectiveness on a robotic arm. Our code, appendix, and video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/rtagrasp/home.",,,,,,

Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects.

State-of-the-art task-based robot grasp synthesis methods fits over-approximated 3D bounding boxes that fails to isolate graspable regions even if they exist. While deep learning or geometrical shape decomposition methods can offer improved approximations, they lack guarantees for the graspability of segmented regions, require prior knowledge of the object, and/or demand large annotated datasets for fine-tuning. In this paper, we overcome these limitations to introduce ITSI. ITSI is a complete, task-oriented grasp synthesis approach that functions independently of object-specific knowledge. ITSI (Iterative Slicing) effectively segments multiple graspable regions that conform to the constraints of robot grippers thereby enabling compatibility with any object a robot seeks to grasp and any robot gripper size. Our extensive real-world and simulation experiments on diverse object datasets demonstrates how ITSI dramatically increases the number of discoverable robot grasps by up to 44% when compared to the state-of-the-art. We also expand ITSI's capabilities beyond task-based robot grasp synthesis to highlight its performance in human affordance segmentation outperforming fully supervised deep learning methods by 1%.",,,,,,

The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform stably across varying conditions. In this study, we extend the idea of using similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered where multiple uncertainties coexist with a single in-hand camera. We achieve this difficult task by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic states.

To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents UASTHN, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions.

Localization 6,Enhancing Feature Tracking Reliability for Visual Navigation Using Real-Time Safety Filter,"Kim, Dabin;Jang, Inkyu;Han, Youngsoo;Hwang, Sunwoo;Kim, H. Jin","Keywords: Sensor-based Control, Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning, View Planning for SLAM","Abstract: Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.",,,,,,

Localization 6,Intensity Triangle Descriptor Constructed from High-Resolution Spinning LiDAR Intensity Image for Loop Closure Detection,"Zhang, Yanfeng;Tian, Yunong;Yang, Guodong;Li, Zhishuo;Luo, Mingrui;Li, En;Jing, Fengshui","Keywords: SLAM, Recognition, Localization","Abstract: LiDAR-based loop closure detection is a crucial part of realizing robust SLAM algorithms for intelligent vehicles with LiDAR sensors. Existing methods often reduce the keypoint dimension to encode the global descriptor, which sacrifices the freedom of loop detection and correction. Based on the 6-DOF rigid transformation property of spatial triangles, we propose an algorithm for extracting and describing 3D keypoints from high-resolution spinning LiDAR intensity images to encode triangle descriptors, termed intensity triangle descriptor (ITD). In comparison to the direct extraction of keypoints from the point cloud, the use of image-derived feature points provides additional photometric texture information and better handles uneven spatial density of the point cloud, which is advantageous in unstructured and geometrically degraded scenes. To enhance the stability of keypoints, the spatial positions of multi-frame image feature points are registered to a keyframe by an odometer for voxel downsampling and non-maximum suppression, with the objective of reducing unstable feature points. For high discrimination, the neighbor image patches of each vertex (keypoint) are aggregated to estimate a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the keypoint signature. An efficient two-stage loop closure detection method is then proposed for ITD, consisting of candidate retrieval based on triangle side lengths and vertex GMMs, followed by geometric verification of matched descriptor pairs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the STheReO, FusionPortable, and our self-collected datasets.",,,,,,
Localization 6,IBTC: An Image-Assisting Binary and Triangle Combined Descriptor for Place Recognition by Fusing LiDAR and Camera Measurements,"Zou, Zuhao;Zheng, Chunran;Yuan, Chongjian;Zhou, Shunbo;Xue, Kaiwen;Zhang, Fu","Keywords: SLAM, Localization, Mapping","Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal descriptor, the image-assisting binary, and triangle combined (iBTC) descriptor, which fuses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and camera measurements for 3D place recognition. The inherent invariance of a triangle to rigid transformations inspires us to design triangle-based descriptors. We first extract distinct 3D key points from both LiDAR and camera measurements and organize them into triplets to form triangles. By utilizing the lengths of the sides of these triangles, we can create triangle descriptors, enabling the rapid retrieval of similar triangles from a database. By encoding the geometric and visual details at the triangle vertices into binary descriptors, we augment the triangle descriptors with richer local information. This enrichment process empowers our descriptors to reject mismatched triangle pairs. Consequently, the remaining matched triangle pairs yield accurate loop closure place indices and relative poses.
In our experiments, we conduct a thorough comparison of our proposed method with several SOTA methods across public and self-collected datasets. The results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance in place recognition and overcomes the limitations associated with unimodal methods like BTC, RING++, ORB-DBoW2, and NetVLAD. Additionally, we performed a time cost benchmark experiment and the result indicates that our methodÂ’s time consumption is reasonable, compared with baseline methods.

Planning under Uncertainty 2,Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence,"Fuentes, Erick;Strader, Jared;Fahnestock, Ethan;Roy, Nicholas",Keywords: Planning under Uncertainty,"Abstract: We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE.",,,,,,

This is an important building block of modern planning algorithms in many application scenarios such as autonomous driving, where noisy sensors perceive obstacles. While many approaches exist, they either provide too conservative estimates of the collision probabilities or are computationally intensive due to their sampling-based nature. To deal with these issues, we introduce Deep Collision Probability Fields, a neural-based approach for computing collision probabilities of arbitrary objects with arbitrary unimodal uncertainty distributions.
Our approach relegates the computationally intensive estimation of collision probabilities via sampling at the training step, allowing for
fast neural network inference of the constraints during planning. In extensive experiments, we show that Deep Collision Probability Fields can produce reasonably accurate collision probabilities (up to 10^{-3}) for planning and that our approach can be easily plugged into standard path planning approaches to plan safe paths on 2-D maps containing uncertain static and dynamic obstacles.

Planning under Uncertainty 2,Rao-Blackwellized POMDP Planning,"Lee, Jiho;Ahmed, Nisar;Wray, Kyle;Sunberg, Zachary","Keywords: Planning under Uncertainty, Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Inference","Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a structured framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but their application requires efficient belief updates. Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filters (SIRPF), also known as Bootstrap Particle Filters, are commonly used as belief updaters in large approximate POMDP solvers, but they face challenges such as particle deprivation and high computational costs as the system's state dimension grows. To address these issues, this study introduces Rao-Blackwellized POMDP (RB-POMDP) approximate solvers and outlines generic methods to apply Rao-Blackwellization in both belief updates and online planning. We compare the performance of SIRPF and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) in a simulated localization problem where an agent navigates toward a target in a GPS-denied environment using POMCPOW and RB-POMCPOW planners.

Planning under Uncertainty 2,Nearest-Neighbourless Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning with Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*),"Wilson, Tyler S.;Thomason, Wil;Kingston, Zachary;Kavraki, Lydia;Gammell, Jonathan","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Manipulation Planning, Constrained Motion Planning","Abstract: Improving the performance of motion planning algorithms for high-degree-of-freedom robots usually requires reducing the cost or frequency of computationally expensive operations. Traditionally, and especially for asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planners, the most expensive operations are local motion validation and querying the nearest neighbours of a configuration. Recent advances have significantly reduced the cost of motion validation by using single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) parallelism to improve solution times for satisficing motion planning problems. These advances have not yet been applied to asymptotically optimal motion planning. This paper presents Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*), the first fully connected, informed, anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) algorithm. FCIT* exploits the radically reduced cost of edge evaluation via SIMD parallelism to build and search fully connected graphs. This removes the need for nearest-neighbours structures, which are a dominant cost for many sampling-based motion planners, and allows it to find initial solutions faster than state-of-the-art ASAO (VAMP, OMPL) and satisficing (OMPL) algorithms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset while converging towards optimal plans in an anytime manner.",,,,,,
Planning under Uncertainty 2,Efficient Path Planning in Complex Environments with Trust Region Continuous Belief Tree Search,"Nunez, Andre Julio;Kong, Felix Honglim;GonzÃ¡lez-Cantos, Alberto;Fitch, Robert","Keywords: Constrained Motion Planning, Motion and Path Planning, Marine Robotics","Abstract: Real-world applications of path planning must contend with complicated constraint and objective functions imposed by the surrounding operational and regulatory environment. Traditional methods such as PRM* and RRT* have asymptotic guarantees, but often struggle in practice with complex black-box objective/constraint functions, especially in compute-limited situations. Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS) addresses these limitations by maintaining local estimates of the objective function in order to sample new nodes from continuous space, often giving high-quality solutions more quickly. However, CBTS requires careful tuning of a control duration parameter, which introduces a tradeoff between compute time and path cost/feasibility. In environments with complex costs and constraints, there may be no single control duration that gives good paths in short compute time. This paper proposes Trust Region CBTS (TR-CBTS), an extension of CBTS with an adaptive control duration parameter inspired by trust region methods. TR-CBTS adjusts control duration based on information from recently sampled candidate nodes, allowing longer control duration where possible to speed up compute time, and shortening control duration when precise navigation in environments with complex, unknown constraint and objective functions. We show TR-CBTS outperforms existing comparable planners for a realistic robotic path planning application in autonomous ship routing.",,,,,,

To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions.

Active Perception,An Active Perception Game for Robust Information Gathering,"He, Siming;Tao, Yuezhan;Spasojevic, Igor;Kumar, Vijay;Chaudhari, Pratik","Keywords: Mapping, Probability and Statistical Methods, Vision-Based Navigation","Abstract: Active perception approaches select future viewpoints by using some estimate of the information gain. An inaccurate estimate can be detrimental in critical situations, e.g., locating a person in distress. However the true information gained can only be calculated post hoc, i.e., after the observation is realized. We present an approach to estimate the discrepancy between the estimated information gain (which is the expectation over putative future observations while neglecting correlations among them) and the true information gain. The key idea is to analyze the mathematical relationship between active perception and the estimation error of the information gain in a game-theoretic setting. Using this, we develop an online estimation approach that achieves sub-linear regret (in the number of time-steps) for the estimation of the true information gain and reduces the sub-optimality of active perception systems. We demonstrate our approach for active perception using a comprehensive set of experiments on: (a) different types of environments, including a quadrotor in a photorealistic simulation, real-world robotic data, and real-world experiments with ground robots exploring indoor and outdoor scenes; (b) different types of robotic perception data; and (c) different map representations. On average, our approach reduces information gain estimation errors by 42%, increases the information gain by 7%, PSNR by 5%, and semantic accuracy (measured as the number of objects that are localized correctly) by 6%. In real-world experiments with a Jackal ground robot, our approach demonstrated complex trajectories to explore occluded regions.",,,,,,

As AMRs are deployed in increasingly diverse environments, the challenge of consistently producing high-quality photographic content remains. Traditional approaches often involve AMRs following a predetermined path while capturing data-intensive imagery, which can be suboptimal, especially in environments with limited connectivity or physical obstructions. These drawbacks necessitate intelligent decision-making to pinpoint optimal vantage points for image capture. Inspired by Next Best View studies, we propose a novel autonomous photography framework that enhances image quality and minimizes the number of photos needed. This framework incorporates a proposed evaluation metric that leverages ray-tracing and Gaussian process interpolation, enabling the assessment of potential visual information from the target in partially known environments.

Active Perception,InstanceVO: Self-Supervised Semantic Visual Odometry by Using Metric Learning to Incorporate Geometrical Priors in Instance Objects,"Xie, Yuanyan;Yang, Junzhe;Zhou, Huaidong;Sun, Fuchun","Keywords: Localization, Semantic Scene Understanding, Autonomous Agents","Abstract: Visual odometry is one of the key technologies for unmanned ground vehicles. To improve the robustness of the systems and enable intelligent tasks, researchers introduced learning-based recognition modules into visual odometry systems, but didn't realize tight coupling between visual odometry systems and recognition modules. This paper proposes a self-supervised semantic visual odometry method, which can complete the tasks of ego-motion estimation, depth prediction, and instance segmentation with a shared encoder. The potential dynamic regions are removed and the image reconstruction loss is rectified by instance detection results. Moreover, the instance-guided triplet loss and cross-task self-attention modules are devised to learn the geometrical relationships among pixels that are implied in instance object priors. The proposed method is validated on KITTI and ComplexUrban datasets. The experimental results show that our method has superiority to baseline models in both pose estimation and depth prediction. We also discuss the efficacy of evaluation metrics for pose estimation, and consider the accumulation errors of trajectories.",,,,,,

However, this additional sensing capability adds complexity and financial cost to a robotic system. Our work investigates the inexpensive alternative of feature extraction via proprioceptive sensing. Our goal is to determine whether proprioceptive data combined with in-hand-manipulation provides sufficient information to enable geometric reconstruction of object profiles. We use a newly designed 3-DOF robotic gripper with variable-friction finger surfaces to perform model-free in-hand-anipulation on a set of test objects comprised of two dimensional convex prisms. We have devised a manipulation sequence based on the rotation and sliding of test objects to allow side-counting with the successful measurement of shapes and sizes with average angle and size errors of 1.64% and 6.76% respectively.

Recent advances in data-driven methods have shown promise, but are sensitive to the quality of training data. Combining learning with classical methods like trajectory optimization and search adds additional structure to the problem and domain knowledge in the form of constraints, which can lead to outperforming the data on which models are trained. We present Diffusion-Informed Probabilistic Contact Search (DIPS), which uses an A* search to plan a sequence of contact modes informed by a diffusion model. We train the diffusion model on a dataset of demonstrations consisting of contact modes and trajectories generated by a trajectory optimizer given those modes. In addition, we use a particle filter-inspired method to reason about variability in diffusion sampling arising from model error, estimating likelihoods of trajectories using a learned discriminator. We show that our method outperforms ablations that do not reason about variability and can plan contact sequences that outperform those found in training data across multiple tasks.

In-Hand Manipulation,Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects Via Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning,"Yan, Qiyang;Ding, Zihan;Zhou, Xin;Spiers, Adam","Keywords: In-Hand Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due to the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an alternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and versatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the hard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to regular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the policy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for any target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data collection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning method with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data. With the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and non-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within 2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data collection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific policies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error being 2.676 mm and 1.902Â°.

However, bridging the sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification. In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information, low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the object's pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects, including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose.",,,,,,

However, a robot's ability to influence can also compromise the physical safety of nearby people if naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE (Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional (39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate during task execution.",,,,,,

Traditional compliance control strategies, such as admittance and impedance control, often lead to unpredictable robot behavior due to incidents like contact loss or unexpected external forces, which can cause significant harm to humans.
To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a multi-task energy-aware impedance controller for kinematically redundant robots. This controller extends the energy-aware impedance control strategy, which ensures the passivity and safety of a single task using a virtual global energy tank, to kinematically redundant robots performing multiple tasks. The proposed controller effectively regulates the power flow of all tasks performed by the robot through a single global energy tank, ensuring the safety and passivity of the tasks.
Experimental results in a shared environment, where external forces are simultaneously applied to the end-effector and the third joint of the Franka Emika Panda, showed that the robot's energy and power, as well as the power of all tasks, consistently remained within predefined thresholds.

In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning between human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share control of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies the data collection process and facilitating simultaneous human demonstration collection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistive agent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are required, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process.

Model Predictive Control,Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs,"Hu, Tianxin;Yuan, Shenghai;Bai, Ruofei;Xu, Xinhang;Liao, Yuwen;Liu, Fen;Xie, Lihua","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Control, Motion and Path Planning, Computational Geometry","Abstract: Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume, but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer and more efficient autonomous systems.",,,,,,
Model Predictive Control,Efficient Trajectory Generation Based on Traversable Planes in 3D Complex Architectural Spaces,"Zhang, Mengke;Tian, Zhihao;Xia, Yaoguang;Xu, Chao;Gao, Fei;Cao, Yanjun","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Field Robots, Nonholonomic Motion Planning","Abstract: With the increasing integration of robots into human life, their role in architectural spaces where people spend most of their time has become more prominent. While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.",,,,,,
Model Predictive Control,Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking against Adversarial Opponents,"Hou, Ruochen;Fernandez, Gabriel Ikaika;Zhu, Mingzhang;Hong, Dennis","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Collision Avoidance, Optimization and Optimal Control","Abstract: In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.",,,,,,

This paper introduces a novel framework that bridges the gap between time-optimal polynomial trajectory generation and optimal control, facilitating efficient online replanning (100 Hz onboard) for multiple quadrotors. Specifically, the proposed method leverages a neural network to learn optimal time allocations for polynomial trajectories, which are then integrated with Model Predictive Contouring Control to fully exploit the dynamics of quadrotors. We further extend this approach to multi-drone systems, enabling collaborative high-speed flight with reciprocal collision avoidance. We benchmark the time-optimal performance and computational efficiency of our method in a drone racing scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in agile cooperative flight within more constrained simulation and real-world environments.

At the framework's high level, an indirect adaptive law estimates the unknown parameters of the reduced-order (template) locomotion model under varying payloads. These estimated parameters feed into an MPC algorithm for real-time trajectory planning, incorporating a convex stability criterion within the MPC constraints to ensure the stability of the template model's estimation error. The optimal reduced-order trajectories generated by the high-level adaptive MPC (AMPC) are then passed to a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (WBC) for tracking. Extensive numerical investigations validate the framework's capabilities, showcasing the robot's proficiency in transporting unmodeled, unknown static payloads up to 109% in experiments on flat terrains and 91% on rough experimental terrains.

Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.",,,,,,

By integrating these inputs with the gaussian splatting technique, our method significantly enhances performance over traditional SLAM approaches. Traditional SLAM techniques often struggle with the limitations of monocular vision and fail to accurately map and locate objects in dynamic and cluttered environments. Purely relying on camera to localize the robot and map creation is challenging in the presence of dynamic obstacles in the scene. To address this, we proposed a multimodal sensor fusion based 3D reconstruction. Our approach employs lidar-based localization to achieve precise positioning of both the camera and the robot, while utilizing the gaussian splatting technique for robust environmental mapping and 3D reconstruction. This approach is robust to dynamic obstacles in the scene. We have conducted extensive experiments in various real-world and simulated environments, demonstrating that our method not only outperforms traditional monocular SLAM approaches but also achieves higher accuracy in terms of localization and constructed map.

To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic visual SLAM system based on local-global fusion neural implicit representation, named DVN-SLAM. To improve the scene representation capability, we introduce a local-global fusion neural implicit representation that enables the construction of an implicit map while considering both global structure and local details. To tackle uncertainties arising from the rendering process, we design an information concentration loss for optimization, aiming to concentrate scene information on object surfaces. The proposed DVN-SLAM achieves competitive performance in localization and mapping across multiple datasets. More importantly, DVN-SLAM demonstrates robustness without semantic and optical flow prior in dynamic scenes, which sets it apart from other NeRF-based methods.",,,,,,

However, they perform poorly in tracking and reconstruction when facing more challenging dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes involving dynamic elements. Although some NeRF-based SLAM methods have attempted to address these dynamic challenges, they rely on RGB-D inputs, and there is a lack of methods that work with pure RGB input. To address these challenges, we introduce Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. For tracking, our method first acquires dynamic object masks through an optical flow estimation system, then combines them with a monocular depth estimation system to obtain merged masks and recover scale. This allows us to remove dynamic objects from non-predefined scenes, enabling dense frame-to-frame mapping. For rendering, we prune the Gaussians generated by pixels with dynamic masks, while applying a scale regularizer to avoid Gaussian artifacts. We impose additional photometric, geometric, and uncertainty losses on the proxy depth to improve rendering accuracy. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) tracking and rendering results in dynamic environments, while also being competitive with or outperforming RGB-D methods.",,,,,,

The proposed control strategy enables repositioning the systemÂ’s center-of-mass by reconfiguring the manipulator configuration and using the end-effector-mounted thrusting mechanism to achieve displacement. The key advantage of the proposed method is that the plume impingement due to thruster firing of the servicer satellite in close-proximity operations towards the client is mitigated. This is achieved by regulating the internal motion of the manipulator such that the thrust firing does not occur near the space asset.

It incorporates external inputs to its dynamics simulation via force/torque sensors mounted to the 2 6-DoF Stewart platforms which compose its primary structure. Each platform is augmented with an additional degree of freedom in the form of an auxiliary axis - one in translation and one in rotation. Previous work has not effectively included the additional workspace provided by these auxiliary axes. Additionally, it limited the use of external force/torque inputs to the case of platform translation only because the external forces/torques due to platform motion and gravitational force were not removed from the sensor inputs prior to inclusion in the dynamic simulation.

Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence, where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback.

This formation was then selected as the desired formation in free swimming for obtaining an expert policy. Next, a long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that maps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler angles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was trained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). The results show that with merely two bilateral pressure sensors and less than one hour of training data, the follower effectively tracked the leader within distances of up to 200 mm (= 1 body length) while swimming at speeds of 155 mm/s (= 0.8 body lengths/s). This work highlights the potential of fish-inspired robots to effectively navigate fluid environments and achieve formation swimming through the use of flow pressure feedback.",,,,,,

First, we examine the characteristics of the bending actuators of the robotic fish. Then, we express the kinematics of the fish as a propagating wave parameterized by three bending amplitudes and a wavelength, which are determined by the flow rates and phase shift of the pumps. We capture various motion patterns generated by different actuator inputs and directly measure the thrust generated by each pattern. We observe that the robotic swimmer can reproduce two different modes of propulsion, that are embodied by two distinct morphological patterns in nature: anguilliform and thunniform. When neither of modes are activated, propulsion is zero or even negative. Finally, we estimate the stationary swimming speed by towing the undulating fish, which satisfies the slip condition (with the speed of the body wave matching the swimming velocity). The analysis of a wide range of kinematic patterns in this study, including two extreme cases of anguilliform and thunniform modes, will provide insights for comprehensive understanding the mechanics of efficient swimming.",,,,,,

The study of obstacle courses provides invaluable insights into the challenges legged robots face, offering a controlled environment to assess and enhance their capabilities. Traversing it with a one-legged hopper introduces intricate challenges, such as planning over contacts and dealing with flight phases, which necessitates a sophisticated controller.

To ensure the feasible utilization of contact forces for maintaining humanoid balance, constraints on the control inputs, Virtual Repellent Point (VRP) and footstep adjustment, and their correlation are analytically formulated into a quadratic form, resulting a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming. Additionally, to enable the humanoid robot to withstand disturbances over a broader range of strides or safely navigates various terrains without encountering knee stretch, the distance between the CoM and the foot is constrained in the 3D-CoM trajectory planner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and real-robot experiments in scenarios involving external disturbances and step down motions.",,,,,,
Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots 2,MPC-QP-Based Control Framework for Compliant Behavior of Humanoid Robots in Physical Collaboration with Humans,"Kumbhar, Shubham;Artemiadis, Panagiotis","Keywords: Legged Robots, Human-Robot Collaboration","Abstract: We present a control framework specifically for physical human-humanoid collaboration involving the transportation and manipulation of heavy objects. Using this framework, the humanoid can exhibit desired levels of compliance with the object to be co-transported. This desired compliance is achieved through an admittance model. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem, based on a novel Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP) model, generates footstep patterns that facilitate this desired compliant behavior while keeping the robot stable. Subsequently, we have an object-informed low-level quadratic program (QP) that sends control input to realize the high-level plans on the robot. The stiffness parameters of the I-LIP are modulated in real time for better compliance tracking performance of the robot. We verify all the results through simulation on the humanoid platform, the Digit, showing the prowess of the framework in collaboratively transporting heavy objects with a human.",,,,,,

This task is challenging for traditional optimization and planning methods to handle due to difficulties in specifying contact mode sequences in real-time. To address this, we use a bi-level contact-implicit planner and hybrid model predictive controller to draft and execute a motion plan. We investigate how this method allows us to plan arm contact events on the shmoobot, a smaller ballbot, which uses an inverse mouse-ball drive to achieve dynamic balancing with a low number of actuators. Through multiple experiments we show how the arms allow for acceleration, deceleration and dynamic obstacle avoidance that are not achievable with the mouse-ball drive alone. This demonstrates how a holistic approach to locomotion can increase the control authority of unique robot morpohologies without additional hardware by leveraging robot arms that are typically used only for manipulation.

While reduced-order models like the Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum (HLIP) are simple and computationally efficient, they lose whole-body expressiveness. Meanwhile, recent advances in Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control (CI-MPC) enable robots to plan through multiple hybrid contact modes, but remain vulnerable to local minima and require significant tuning. We propose a control framework that combines the strengths of HLIP and CI-MPC. The reduced-order model generates a nominal gait, while CI-MPC manages the whole-body dynamics and modifies the contact schedule as needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulation with a novel 24 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot: Achilles.

At the core of the proposed framework is a cascaded-fidelity model predictive controller (CAFE-MPC). CAFE-MPC strategically relaxes the planning problem along the prediction horizon (i.e., with descending model fidelity, increasingly coarse time steps, and relaxed constraints) for computational and performance gains. This problem is numerically solved with an efficient customized multiple-shooting iLQR (MS-iLQR) solver. The action-value function from CAFE-MPC is then used as the basis for a new value-function-based whole-body control (VWBC) technique that avoids additional tuning for the WBC. We show that CAFE-MPC if configured appropriately, advances the performance of whole-body MPC without necessarily increasing computational cost. Further, we show the superior performance of the proposed VWBC over the Ricatti feedback controller in terms of constraint handling. The proposed framework enables accomplishing for the first time gymnastic-style running barrel roll on the MIT Mini Cheetah.",,,,,,
Perception for Manipulation 3,Accurate Robotic Pushing Manipulation through Online Model Estimation under Uncertain Object Properties,"Lee, Yongseok;Kim, Keehoon","Keywords: Model Learning for Control, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental non-prehensile manipulation skill essential for handling objects that are difficult to grasp. This letter proposes a highly accurate robotic pushing framework that utilizes an online estimated model to push objects along a given nominal trajectory, despite uncertain object properties such as friction coefficients, mass distribution, and the position of the center of friction (CoF). The core concept involves estimating an optimal pushing motion model capable of representing observed local motions. A generalized form of the conventional analytical model, coupled with a moving-window Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), serves as the online estimated model. It captures the local behavior of the pushed objects and is integrated with a model predictive control-based pushing strategy to achieve precise pushing performance. In experiments, the proposed robotic pushing framework demonstrated superior accuracy in tracking the given nominal trajectory compared to the conventional analytical model and data-driven model approaches, even when the motion model was perturbed.

However, even when sensors share the same sensing principle, variations in production factors can lead to differences in the color patterns of tactile signals. Unlike common vision tasks, vision-based tactile perception depends on tracking light variation in colorful signals, making it more susceptible to lighting conditions and thus more prone to domain gaps. In this paper, we propose an Omni-hardness perception framework that enables adaptation across various vision-based tactile sensors. Firstly, in-depth analyses of the factors influencing the generalization of hardness perception are presented. Furthermore, the light balance module and the force scale module are coupled to regulate network learning of generalized representations. Experimental results across multiple sensors demonstrate the transferability of learned representations. Additionally, downstream tasks in natural object perception, tumor detection, and grasping stability prediction, are proposed to evaluate the potential applications. The frameworkÂ’s performance shows promise for advancing general tactile sensing and embodied tactile perception.",,,,,,

Specifically, when subtle changes happen during correcting the object state, not only proprioception but also tactile information from the entire hand can be beneficial. However, switching motions with high-DOFs of multiple fingers and abundant tactile information is still challenging. In this study, we propose a loss function with constraints of touch states and an attention mechanism for focusing on important modalities depending on the touch states. The policy model is AE-LSTM which consists of Autoencoder (AE) which compresses abundant tactile information and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which switches the motion depending on the touch states. Motion for cap-opening was chosen as a target task which consists of subtasks of sliding an object and opening its cap. As a result, the proposed method achieved the best success rates with a variety of objects for real time cap-opening manipulation.

Tactile sensing, which compensates for visual information, offers rich texture-based or force-based data for object pose estimation. However, previous methods for pose estimation typically overlook dynamic situations, such as slippage of grasped objects or movement of contacted objects during interactions with the environment, thus increasing the complexity of pose estimation. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method that utilizes visual and tactile sensing to estimate object poses through particle filtering. We leverage visual information to track the pose of the contacted object in real-time and estimate the pose changes of the grasped object using displacement data obtained from tactile sensors. Our experimental evaluation on 13 objects with diverse geometric shapes demonstrated the ability to estimate high-precision poses, which revealed the robot's powerful ability to cope with dynamic scenes for compelled motion of objects, proving our framework's adaptability in practical scenarios with uncertainty.",,,,,,

Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search.

We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversaryÂ’s goal is to delay the robotÂ’s timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithmÂ’s robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.",,,,,,

It fuses the advantages of sampling-based MPC, which can cope with nonconvex costmaps through random sampling of trajectories, with the advantages of gradient-based MPC, which can generate smooth trajectories. In addition, we leverage a generalized safety-embedded MPC problem definition with a discrete barrier state (DBaS). The proposed framework has three steps: 1) a costmap builder to generate the barrier function map, 2) a seed trajectory generator to choose randomly generated trajectories to send to the optimizers, and 3) a batch trajectory optimizer to optimize each of the seed trajectories and select the best trajectory. Experiments with real-time simulations compare the effectiveness of the proposed framework, sampling-based MPC, and gradient-based MPC, which optimizes a single trajectory. The experiments also compare the application of two different control sequence sampling schemes to the proposed framework.

Collision Avoidance 1,Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety,"Fontanari, Elias;Lunardi, Gianni;Saveriano, Matteo;Del Prete, Andrea","Keywords: Robot Safety, Optimization and Optimal Control, Motion Control","Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe set constraint recede along the horizon. In this paper we push that idea further. We suggest to exploit parallel computation for solving several MPC problems at the same time. Each problem instantiate the safe set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved, even using as little as 4 computational cores.",,,,,,

Collision Avoidance 1,Real-Time Safe Bipedal Robot Navigation Using Linear Discrete Control Barrier Functions,"Peng, Chengyang;Paredes, Victor;Castillo, Guillermo A.;Hereid, Ayonga","Keywords: Humanoid and Bipedal Locomotion, Integrated Planning and Control, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: Safe navigation in real-time is an essential task for humanoid robots in real-world deployment. Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF constraints. We validate our proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate in a clustered environment in real-time.",,,,,,

The framework takes two sets of predictions from different algorithms and associates their inconsistencies with the collision risk via fuzzy inference. The first set of predictions is obtained by retrieving safety-critical 2.5D objects from a depth map, and the second set comes from the ordinary AV's 3D object detector. We experimentally validate that, based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a depth discrepancy measure, the inconsistencies between the two sets of predictions strongly correlate to the error of the 3D object detector against ground truths. This correlation allows us to construct a fuzzy inference system and map the inconsistency measures to an AV collision risk indicator. In particular, we optimize the fuzzy inference system towards an existing offline metric that matches AV collision rates well. Lastly, we validate our monitor's capability to produce relevant risk estimates with the large-scale nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it can safeguard an AV in closed-loop simulations.",,,,,,
Collision Avoidance 1,Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems Via CBF-Inspired Risk Measurement,"Zhang, Yanze;Lyu, Yiwei;Jo, Siwon;Yang, Yupeng;Luo, Wenhao","Keywords: Autonomous Agents, Agent-Based Systems, Multi-Robot Systems","Abstract: Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock --- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 3,SEAL: A Sample-Efficient Adjustment-Learning Method for Table Tennis Robot Serve,"Guo, Qitong;Shi, Xiaohang;Murakami, Kenichi;Jia, Ruoyu;Yamakawa, Yuji","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Task and Motion Planning, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: Table tennis robots have significantly advanced in performance owing to the rapid progress in deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies. However, these advancements often require a large number of training samples. Besides, research focused on the robot serve task remains relatively limited. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a sample-efficient adjustment-learning (SEAL) method for the serve task inspired by human experience in table tennis, which can inherently augment the available training samples without the need for additional sample collection. The adjustment learning does not require complex network structures but demonstrates superior performances. The models trained by adjustment learning have good generalization and robustness, that can adapt to different serve styles and reduce system transfer errors very efficiently. In addition, the random interpolation method during dataset generation stage is introduced, and the effectiveness of simultaneous learning in both joint space and Cartesian space is also demonstrated. For specific serve task, an accuracy of less than 30 mm to any designated position at the first shot is achieved.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 3,Inference Based Multi-Object Reactive Search in a Partially Known Environment with Temporal Logic Specifications,"Kang, Yaohui;Chen, Ziyang;Xia, Yanjie;Kan, Zhen","Keywords: Task and Motion Planning, Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Efficiently searching for multiple objects in a partially known environment, where only the names and locations of landmarks are available, presents significant challenges. Existing search algorithms in the literature fail to fully utilize prior knowledge to improve search efficiency, and exhibit significantly diminished efficiency when extended to multi- object search. To address these limitations, we propose an inference-based multi-object reactive search framework. This framework utilizes the COMET inference model to reason about co-occurrence values between the target objects and known landmarks, thereby enhancing search efficiency. These co-occurrence values are integrated into a reactive temporal logic motion planning strategy, which allows the robot search for multiple objects with temporal logic constraints specified by LTL and adapt dynamically if the inferred reasoning differs from the actual object arrangement encountered during the search. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed motion planning algorithm. Results demonstrate that the integration of commonsense reasoning with reactive temporal logic planning significantly improves multi-object search efficiency.

Task and Motion Planning 3,Planning with Adaptive World Models for Autonomous Driving,"Vasudevan, Arun Balajee;Peri, Neehar;Schneider, Jeff;Ramanan, Deva","Keywords: Task and Motion Planning, Behavior-Based Systems, Robust/Adaptive Control","Abstract: Motion planning is crucial for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 3,Subassembly to Full Assembly: Effective Assembly Sequence Planning through Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning,"Shu, Chang;Kim, Anton;Park, Shinkyu","Keywords: Task and Motion Planning, Assembly, Manipulation Planning","Abstract: This paper proposes an assembly sequence planning framework, named Subassembly to Assembly (S2A). The framework is designed to enable a robotic manipulator to assemble multiple parts in a prespecified structure by leveraging object manipulation actions. The primary technical challenge lies in the exponentially increasing complexity of identifying a feasible assembly sequence as the number of parts grows. To address this, we introduce a graph-based reinforcement learning approach, where a graph attention network is trained using a delayed reward assignment strategy. In this strategy, rewards are assigned only when an assembly action contributes to the successful completion of the assembly task. We validate the framework's performance through physics-based simulations, comparing it against various baselines to emphasize the significance of the proposed reward assignment approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of deploying our framework in a real-world robotic assembly scenario.",,,,,,

To address this problem, we propose Language Instruction grounding for Motion Planning (LIMP), an approach that enables robots to verifiably follow complex, open-ended instructions in real-world environments without prebuilt semantic maps. LIMP constructs a symbolic instruction representation that reveals the robotÂ’s alignment with an instructorÂ’s intended motives and affords the synthesis of correct-by-construction robot behaviors. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of LIMP on 150 instructions across five real-world environments, demonstrating its versatility and ease of deployment in diverse, unstructured domains. LIMP performs comparably to state-of-the-art baselines on standard open-vocabulary tasks and additionally achieves a 79% success rate on complex spatiotemporal instructions, significantly outperforming baselines that only reach 38%.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 3,A Hierarchical Approach for Joint Task Allocation and Path Planning,"Ho, Florence;Higa, Ryota;Kato, Takuro;Nakadai, Shinji","Keywords: Task Planning, Multi-Robot Systems, Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents","Abstract: This paper addresses the joint task allocation and path planning problem, whereby a fleet of vehicles must be optimally assigned to service multiple given tasks while their planned paths must be collision-free. Such a problem composed of two tightly coupled optimization problems has a high complexity with the number of tasks and the number of vehicles, thus optimal solvers do not scale to large size instances. Therefore, we propose a novel method to solve this problem, HTAPPS, which introduces a hierarchical resolution framework. Our proposed approach decomposes a given instance into three levels of abstractions and associated amount of details that progressively filter the search space. This allows us to reduce the computational effort required when performing task allocation and multi-agent path planning jointly.

to enable multiple robots to operate in complex environments. Most CSLAM techniques rely on raw sensor measurement or low-level features such as keyframe descriptors, which can lead to wrong loop closures due
to the lack of deep understanding of the environment. Moreover, the exchange of these measurements and low-level features among the robots requires the transmission of a significant amount of data, which limits
the scalability of the system. To overcome these limitations, we present Multi S-Graphs, a decentralized CSLAM system that utilizes high-level semantic-relational information embedded in the four-layered

Multi-Robot Systems 6,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Coordinated Payload Transport in Biped-Wheeled Robots,"Mehta, Dhruv K;Joglekar, Ajinkya;Krovi, Venkat","Keywords: Cooperating Robots, Multi-Robot Systems, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Coordinated payload transport via a fleet of modular wheeled mobile robots offers flexibility for handling larger loads in indoor and outdoor environments. Biped-wheeled robots have recently emerged as a viable architecture for an independent/stand-alone wheeled mobile robot. In this work, we explore the use of two biped-wheeled robots that can leverage their mobility and maneuvarability for enhanced spatial pose control and stabilization for various payload transport tasks. However, coordinated control of multiple articulated wheeled robots for path tracking of a payload presents significant (and potentially competing) challenges, including kinematic redundancy, stability concerns, relative motion between the payload and robots, and precise motion control to achieve effective coordination. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework to develop the motion-plans for the system. In particular, this approach generates the ego robot's body twist and the follower robot's relative twist with respect to the ego robot. By formulating the action space of the follower robot as a relative twist, our approach facilitates pairwise interactions between robots. Furthermore, we use only relative pose information and the errors as states for the DRL controller, thereby making it agnostic to initial conditions and avoiding explicit dependency on absolute pose. We validate our approach through simulations conducted in Isaac Sim and on hardware using Diablo biped-wheeled robots with zero-shot transfer, demonstrating effective payload path tracking across varying parameters.",,,,,,

Multi-Robot Systems 6,Multi-Agent Inverse Q-Learning from Demonstrations,"Haynam, Nathaniel;Khoja, Adam;Kumar, Dhruv;Myers, Vivek;BÄ±yÄ±k, Erdem","Keywords: Multi-Robot Systems, Imitation Learning","Abstract: When reward functions are hand-designed, deep reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from reward misspecification, causing them to learn suboptimal policies. In the single-agent case, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) techniques attempt to address this issue by inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. However, in multi-agent problems, misalignment between the learned and true objectives is exacerbated due to increased environment non-stationarity and variance that scale with multiple agents. As such, in multi-agent general-sum games, multi-agent IRL algorithms have difficulty balancing cooperative and competitive objectives. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Agent Marginal Q-Learning from Demonstrations (MAMQL), a novel sample-efficient framework for multi-agent IRL. For each agent, MAMQL learns a critic marginalized over the other agents' policies, allowing for a well-motivated use of Boltzmann policies in the multi-agent context. We identify a connection between optimal marginalized critics and single-agent soft-Q IRL, allowing us to apply a direct, simple optimization criterion from the single-agent domain. Across our experiments on three different simulated domains, MAMQL significantly outperforms previous multi-agent methods in average reward, sample efficiency, and reward recovery by often more than 2-5x.

Robot Vision 2,Unified Human Localization and Trajectory Prediction with Monocular Vision,"Luan, Po-Chien;Gao, Yang;Demonsant, CÃ©line;Alahi, Alexandre","Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems, Localization, Computer Vision for Transportation","Abstract: Conventional human trajectory prediction models rely on clean curated data, requiring specialized equipment or manual labeling, which is often impractical for robotic applications. The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: BirdÂ’s Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction.

Specifically, we introduce an explicit geometric map for 3D representation and high-fidelity rendering, allowing the generation of high-quality synthesized views to support accurate visual localization. Our method demonstrates higher localization accuracy compared to NeRF-based neural rendering localization approaches.

Robot Vision 2,Depth Estimation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting Siamese Defocus,"Zhang, Jinchang;Xu, Ningning;Zhang, Hao;Lu, Guoyu","Keywords: Range Sensing, Mapping, RGB-D Perception","Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.",,,,,,
Robot Vision 2,GSFusion: Online RGB-D Mapping Where Gaussian Splatting Meets TSDF Fusion,"Wei, Jiaxin;Leutenegger, Stefan","Keywords: Mapping, RGB-D Perception","Abstract: Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.

Robot Vision 2,Monocular 360 Depth Estimation Via Spherical Fully-Connected CRFs,"Cao, Zidong;Wang, Lin","Keywords: Omnidirectional Vision, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Monocular 360 depth estimation poses significant challenges due to the inherent distortion of the equirectangular projection (ERP). This distortion separates adjacent spherical points after their projection onto the ERP plane, especially in the polar regions, resulting in insufficient spherical relationships. To address this issue, recent methods calculate spherical neighbors within the tangent domain. However, since the tangent patch and the sphere share only one common point, spherical relationships are established only among neighbors around this common point. In this paper, we propose Spherical Fully-Connected CRFs (SF-CRFs). We start by evenly partitioning an ERP image into regular windows, where windows at the equator have broader spherical neighbors than those at the poles. To enhance spherical relationships, our SF-CRFs feature two key components. Firstly, to include sufficient spherical neighbors, we introduce a Spherical Window Transform (SWT) module. This module replicates the equator windowÂ’s spherical relationships across all other windows, leveraging the rotational invariance of the sphere. Remarkably, the transformation process is efficient, transforming all windows in a 512x1024 ERP image in just 0.038 seconds on a CPU. Secondly, we introduce a Planar-Spherical Interaction (PSI) module to calculate the SF-CRFs, which facilitates the relationships between regular and transformed windows. By integrating SF-CRFs blocks into a decoder, we propose CRF360D, a novel 360 depth estimation framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets. Our CRF360D is compatible with different perspective image-trained backbones, serving as the encoder.",,,,,,

In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional ""quotient"" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.",,,,,,
Motion Control 1,Quadratic Programming-Based Reference Spreading Control for Dual-Arm Robotic Manipulation with Planned Simultaneous Impacts,"van Steen, Jari J.;van den Brandt, Gijs;van de Wouw, Nathan;Kober, Jens;Saccon, Alessandro","Keywords: Impact-aware manipulation, Motion Control of Manipulators, Dual Arm Manipulation, Learning from Demonstration","Abstract: With the aim of further enabling the exploitation of intentional impacts in robotic manipulation, a control framework is presented that directly tackles the challenges posed by tracking control of robotic manipulators that are tasked to perform nominally simultaneous impacts. This framework is an extension of the reference spreading (RS) control framework, in which overlapping anteand post-impact references that are consistent with impact dynamics are defined. In this work, such a reference is constructed starting from a teleoperation-based approach. By using the corresponding ante- and post-impact control modes in the scope of a quadratic programming control approach, peaking of the velocity error and control inputs due to impacts is avoided while maintaining high tracking performance. With the inclusion of a novel interim mode, we aim to also avoid input peaks and steps when uncertainty in the environment causes a series of unplanned single impacts to occur rather than the planned simultaneous impact. This work in particular presents for the first time an experimental evaluation of RS control on a robotic setup, showcasing its robustness against uncertainty in the environment compared to three baseline control approaches.",,,,,,
Motion Control 1,HARMONIOUS - Human-Like Reactive Motion Control and Multimodal Perception for Humanoid Robots,"Rozlivek, Jakub;Roncone, Alessandro;Pattacini, Ugo;Hoffmann, Matej","Keywords: Humanoid Robots, Physical Human-Robot Interaction, Collision Avoidance, Biologically-Inspired Robots","Abstract: For safe and effective operation of humanoid robots in human-populated environments, the problem of commanding a large number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) while simultaneously considering dynamic obstacles and human proximity has still not been solved. We present a new reactive motion controller that commands two arms of a humanoid robot and three torso joints (17 DoF in total). We formulate a quadratic program that seeks joint velocity commands respecting multiple constraints while minimizing the magnitude of the velocities. We introduce a new unified treatment of obstacles that dynamically maps visual and proximity (pre-collision) and tactile (post-collision) obstacles as additional constraints to the motion controller, in a distributed fashion over the surface of the upper body of the iCub robot (with 2000 pressure-sensitive receptors). This results in a bio-inspired controller that: (i) gives rise to a robot with whole-body visuo-tactile awareness, resembling peripersonal space representations, and (ii) produces human-like minimum jerk movement profiles. The controller was extensively experimentally validated, including a physical human-robot interaction scenario.",,,,,,
Resiliency and Security 1,FedDet: Data Poisoning Attack Detection for Federated Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Kim, Min Hyuk;Lee, Eungi;Yoo, Seok Bong","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Recognition","Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) models often centralize skeleton data, increasing significant privacy concerns. To address this, decentralized training models for SAR have been advanced, particularly using federated learning (FL), a research area of considerable value with wide-ranging applications, including human-robot interaction, camera-enabled devices, and security surveillance. However, FL-based SAR faces the challenge of substantial accuracy degradation due to data poisoning attacks; thus, it requires the identification of malicious clients. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting data poisoning attacks in federated SAR, called FedDet. The method involves creating prototypes of perspective transform and exchanging these matrices between the clients and server to identify the malicious client. Additionally, a prototype-guided attack detector is developed, incorporating spatiotemporal matching to analyze the correlation between prototype skeleton data. Experimental results on FL frameworks and SAR models demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models.

Resiliency and Security 1,Prepared for the Worst: Resilience Analysis of the ICP Algorithm Via Learning-Based Worst-Case Adversarial Attacks,"Zhang, Ziyu;Laconte, Johann;Lisus, Daniil;Barfoot, Timothy","Keywords: Localization, Deep Learning Methods, Robot Safety","Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for assessing the resilience of the ICP algorithm via learning-based, worst-case attacks on lidar point clouds. For safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, ensuring the resilience of algorithms before deployments is crucial. The ICP algorithm is the standard for lidar-based localization, but its accuracy can be greatly affected by corrupted measurements from various sources, including occlusions, adverse weather, or mechanical sensor issues. Unfortunately, the complex and iterative nature of ICP makes assessing its resilience to corruption challenging. While there have been efforts to create challenging datasets and develop simulations to evaluate the resilience of ICP, our method focuses on finding the maximum possible ICP error that can arise from corrupted measurements at a location. We demonstrate that our perturbation-based adversarial attacks can be used pre-deployment to identify locations on a map where ICP is particularly vulnerable to corruptions in the measurements. With such information, autonomous robots can take safer paths when deployed, to mitigate against their measurements being corrupted. The proposed attack outperforms baselines more than 88% of the time across a wide range of scenarios.",,,,,,

These services heavily rely on map-based traffic information to reduce uncertainties in recognizing lane shapes, traffic light locations, and traffic signs. Achieving this level of reliance on map information requires centimeter-level localization accuracy, which is currently only achievable with LiDAR sensors. However, LiDAR is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks that emit malicious lasers against LiDAR to overwrite its measurements. Once localization is compromised, the attack could lead the victim off roads or make them ignore traffic lights. Motivated by these serious safety implications, we design SLAMSpoof, the first practical LiDAR spoofing attack on localization systems for self-driving to assess the actual attack significance on autonomous vehicles. SLAMSpoof can effectively find the effective attack location based on our scan matching vulnerability score (SMVS), a point-wise metric representing the potential vulnerability to spoofing attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the attack, we conduct real-world experiments on ground vehicles and confirm its high capability in real-world scenarios, inducing position errors of â‰?.2 meters (more than typical lane width) for all 3 popular LiDAR-based localization algorithms. We finally discuss the potential countermeasures of this attack. Code is available at https://github.com/Keio-CSG/slamspoof",,,,,,
Resiliency and Security 1,Gradient-Based Adversarial Attacks on Deep LiDAR Odometry,"Song, Zhenbo;Chen, Xuanzhu;Zhang, Zhenyuan;Zhang, Kaihao;Lu, Jianfeng;Li, Weiqing","Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems, Robot Safety, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Adversarial attacks have been recently investigated in LiDAR perception problems for autonomous driving, where a small perturbation to the source inputs can result in incorrect predictions. However, most prior studies focus on attacks on single-frame perception modules, lacking explorations of attacks on consecutive-frame tasks, i.e. the LiDAR odometry. In this paper, we propose a gradient optimization-based adversarial attack towards deep LiDAR odometry networks. To generate point clouds consistent with real-world scenarios, we constrain adversarial points within the range of a small object, e.g. a traffic cone, and render new points to simulate real LiDAR measurements. By incorporating such adversarial points in consecutive frames, we demonstrate a significant decrease in pose estimation accuracy of current popular LiDAR odometry networks. In addition, we also evaluate traditional geometric odometry approaches and report their robustness over adversarial points. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method and the vulnerability of deep LiDAR odometry methods against adversarial points.",,,,,,
Resiliency and Security 1,Enhancing 3D Robotic Vision Robustness by Minimizing Adversarial Mutual Information through a Curriculum Training Approach,"Darabi, Nastaran;Jayasuriya, Dinithi;Naik, Devashri;Tulabandhula, Theja;Trivedi, Amit Ranjan","Keywords: Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Deep Learning Methods, Robot Safety","Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries through small, carefully crafted perturbations that lead to significant mispredictions. In 3D vision, the high dimensionality and sparsity of data greatly expand the attack surface, making 3D vision particularly vulnerable for safety-critical robotics. To enhance 3D vision's adversarial robustness, we propose a training objective that simultaneously minimizes prediction loss and mutual information (MI) under adversarial perturbations to contain the upper bound of misprediction errors. This approach simplifies handling adversarial examples compared to conventional methods, which require explicit searching and training on adversarial samples. However, minimizing prediction loss conflicts with minimizing MI, leading to reduced robustness and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we integrate curriculum advisors in the training setup that gradually introduce adversarial objectives to balance training and prevent models from being overwhelmed by difficult cases early in the process. The advisors also enhance robustness by encouraging training on diverse MI examples through entropy regularizers. We evaluated our method on ModelNet40 and KITTI using PointNet, DGCNN, SECOND, and PointTransformers, achieving 2--5% accuracy gains on ModelNet40 and a 5--10% mAP improvement in object detection.

However, they face challenges traversing unstructured terrain such as stepped obstacles. This paper presents the design and testing of the PaTS-Wheel: a Passively-Transformable Single-part Wheel that can transform to render hooks when presented with obstacles. The passive rendering of this useful morphological feature is guided purely by the geometry of the obstacle. The energy consumption and vibrational profile of the PaTS-Wheel on flat ground is comparable to a standard wheel of the same size. In addition, our novel wheel design (with a diameter of 120 mm) was tested traversing different terrains with stepped obstacles of incremental heights. The PaTS-Wheel achieved 100 % success rate at traversing stepped obstacles 83 mm high (~ 70 % its diameter), higher than the results obtained for an equivalent wheel at 30 mm (~ 25 % its diameter) and an equivalent wheg at 73 mm (~ 61% its diameter).

This is particularly useful when the shape or position of the objects cannot be accurately determined because of sensor limitations. This gripper has multiple pins whose tips are covered by flexible balloons. The gripper can adapt to the shapes of objects in two steps: axial sliding of the pins and radial inflation of the balloons. This study focuses on the effect of the layout of pins on grasping and proposes a simulation model to quantify the characteristics of each layout. Simulations showed that the concentric layout enables stable grasping by ensuring many pins contact the object, regardless of misalignment. Experiments using a prototype gripper demonstrated a trend consistent with the simulation results, proving the validity of the simulation model.",,,,,,

The most critical issue for multirotor type is the limited flight time due to the large power consumption for hovering against gravity. Inspired by nature, various research focus on the perching and grasping ability by deploying a gripper on the multirotor to grasp arboreal environments for saving energy; however, most the mechanical design for gripper restricts the approach path, which significantly limits the performance of perching and grasping. Besides, it is also challenging to design a light gripper that also offers sufficiently large grip force to hang itself.

This is enabled by a custom lightweight, high-torque, low rotor inertia, five degree-of-freedom arm capable of high acceleration. To generate swing trajectories, we formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) that constrains the state of the paddle at the time of the strike. The terminal position is given by a predicted ball trajectory, and the terminal orientation and velocity of the paddle are chosen to match various possible styles of hits: loops (topspin), drives (flat), and chops (backspin). Finally, we construct a fixed-horizon model predictive controller (MPC) around this OCP to allow the hardware to quickly react to changes in the predicted ball trajectory.

To increase process throughput, some manufacturers propose a dual-arm setup to overcome the speed limitation of a single robot. Industrial robot motion is programmed through waypoints connected by motion primitives (Cartesian linear and circular paths and linear joint paths at constant Cartesian speed). The actual robot motion is affected by the blending between these motion primitives and the pose of the robot (an outstretched/near-singularity pose tends to have larger path-tracking errors). Choosing the waypoints and the speed along each motion segment to achieve the performance requirement is challenging. At present, there is no automated solution, and laborious manual tuning by robot experts is needed to approach the desired performance. In this letter, we present a systematic three-step approach to designing and programming a dual-arm system to optimize system performance. The first step is to select the relative placement between the two robots based on the specified relative motion path. The second step is to select the relative waypoints and the motion primitives. The final step is to update the waypoints iteratively based on the actual measured relative motion. Waypoint iteration is first executed in simulation and then completed using the actual robots. For performance assessment, we use the mean path speed subject to the relative position and orientation constraints and the path speed uniformity constraint. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on two systems, a physical testbed of two ABB robots and a simulation testbed of two FANUC robots, for two challenging test curves.",,,,,,

This paper presents an antagonistic stiffening mechanism combining pneumatic actuation with tendon locking to achieve configuration- and stiffness control. Elongation of a soft pneumatic section, resulting from air actuation, is opposed by constraining the length of integrated tendons. These tendons can be locked in length by pneumatically activated levers at the base of each segment. Hence, tendon locking will not affect the configuration of other segments of a multi-segment manipulator. Our concept achieves a stiffness increase of up to 201.7% and a larger, more uniform radial workspace compared to the widely used pneumatic actuation concept while maintaining the low technical effort required for actuation. We also demonstrate how our actuation concept enables independent control of stiffness levels for individual segments of a multi-segment manipulator and their MR compatibility.",,,,,,

However, the deformation and motion of soft magnetic robots rely on both their structural design and magnetization, which complicates the guided movement and balance maintenance for aquatic environments. In this work, inspired by the flat and symmetrical body of rays, we design a soft magnetic fish-shaped robot capable of flexible motions and trajectory swimming on the water surface. This robot features the muscle made of magnetic elastomer, which connects with the acrylic skeleton and silicone film fins with a soft body. In the external magnetic field, the robot achieves hovering by flapping its fins, driven by the magnetically actuated deformation of its magnetic muscle. Besides, the robot's axial magnetization enables the rapid steering guided by a horizontal field. In experiments, the soft magnetic robot was tasked with performing a looping figure-eight trajectory movement on the water surface, guided by the field gradient generated by a dense planar electromagnetic coils' array.

The key to this system lies in the finger's unique metamaterial structure, which facilitates omni-directional passive adaptation during grasping, protecting delicate objects across diverse scenarios. A compact in-finger camera captures high-framerate images of the finger's deformation during contact, extracting crucial tactile data in real time. We present a volumetric discretized model of the soft finger and use the geometry constraints captured by the camera to find the optimal estimation of the deformed shape. The approach is benchmarked using a motion capture system with sparse markers and a haptic device with dense measurements. Both results show state-of-the-art accuracies, with a median error of 1.96 mm for overall body deformation, corresponding to 2.1% of the finger's length. More importantly, the state estimation is robust in both on-land and underwater environments, as we demonstrate its usage for underwater object shape sensing. This combination of passive adaptation and real-time tactile sensing paves the way for amphibious robotic grasping applications.

Planning with Contact,Fast Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control,"Le Cleac'h, Simon;Howell, Taylor;Yang, Shuo;Lee, Chi-Yen;Zhang, John;Bishop, Arun;Schwager, Mac;Manchester, Zachary","Keywords: Optimization and Optimal Control, Model Predictive Control, Legged Robots, Motion Control","Abstract: We present a general approach for controlling robotic systems that make and break contact with their environments. Contact-implicit model predictive control (CI-MPC) generalizes linear MPC to contact-rich settings by utilizing a bi-level planning formulation with lower-level contact dynamics formulated as time-varying linear complementarity problems (LCPs) computed using strategic Taylor approximations about a reference trajectory. These dynamics enable the upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point solver for these LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for the tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot. We also show that the controller is robust to model mismatch and can respond to disturbances by discovering and exploiting new contact modes across a variety of robotic systems in simulation, including a pushbot, planar hopper, planar quadruped, and planar biped.",,,,,,

We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms. This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods. Given the digital assets, we propose a manipulable Real2Sim pipeline that standardizes coordinate systems and scales, ensuring the seamless integration of multiple components. In addition to reconstructing the robotic arm, the surrounding static background and objects can be holistically reconstructed, enabling seamless interactions between the robotic arm and its environment.

The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases.",,,,,,

Robotic US systems (RUSS) offer the potential to enhance imaging consistency by leveraging real-time US image feedback to optimize the probe pose, thereby reducing reliance on operator expertise. However, determining the proper approach to extracting generalizable features from the US images for probe pose adjustment remains challenging. In this work, we propose a SIP navigation framework for RUSS, exemplified in the context of robotic lung ultrasound (LUS). This framework facilitates automatic probe adjustment when in proximity to the SIP. This is achieved by explicitly extracting multiple anatomical features presented in real-time LUS images and performing non-patient-specific template matching to generate probe motion towards the SIP using image-based visual servoing (IBVS).

To alleviate the challenge of limited field of view associated with single intraoperative image, more than one intraoperative images can be leveraged and the multi-view 2D/3D registration is thus needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the combined loss function consisting of the differences between the predicted and ground-truth poses, and dissimilarities (e.g., normalized crosscorrelation) between the simulated and observed intraoperative images. More importantly, the additional cross-view training loss terms are formulated for both pose and image loss, to explicitly consider the cross-view constraints. In the second stage, the test-time optimization is conducted to refine the estimated poses in the coarse stage.

"Imaging, Scanning, Localization",Improving Probe Localization for Freehand 3D Ultrasound Using Lightweight Cameras,"Huang, Dianye;Navab, Nassir;Jiang, Zhongliang","Keywords: Medical Robots and Systems, Computer Vision for Medical Robotics","Abstract: Ultrasound (US) probe localization relative to the examined subject is essential for freehand 3D US imaging, which offers significant clinical value due to its affordability and unrestricted field of view. However, existing methods often rely on expensive tracking systems or bulky probes, while recent US image-based deep learning methods suffer from accumulated errors during probe maneuvering. To address these challenges, this study proposes a versatile, cost-effective probe pose localization method for freehand 3D US imaging, utilizing two lightweight cameras. To eliminate accumulated errors during US scans, we introduce PoseNet, which directly predicts the probe's 6D pose relative to a preset world coordinate system based on camera observations. We first jointly train pose and camera image encoders based on pairs of 6D pose and camera observations densely sampled in simulation. This will encourage each pair of probe pose and its corresponding camera observation to share the same representation in latent space. To ensure the two encoders handle unseen images and poses effectively, we incorporate a triplet loss that enforces smaller differences in latent features between nearby poses compared to distant ones. Then, the pose decoder uses the latent representation of the camera images to predict the probe's 6D pose. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, in the real world, we use the trained image encoder and pose decoder for initial predictions, followed by an additional MLP layer to refine the estimated pose, improving accuracy. The results obtained from an arm phantom demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which notably surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving average positional and rotational errors of 2.03 mm and 0.37 deg, respectively.",,,,,,

Therefore, recognizing contact state transitions is essential in order to determine whether to continue the current task or proceed to the next. In that context, learning-based solutions have shown outstanding results. However, these methods heavily rely on balanced datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the short duration of certain contact states and rare failure cases. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for estimating contact state transitions using anomaly detection through input data reconstruction. The proposed framework operates in a semi-supervised manner, eliminating the need for balanced datasets during training. For input data reconstruction, a convolutional neural network is combined with a variational autoencoder to process various sensor measurements as a multivariate time series.

Besides, due to the complex geometric structure of CECs and the presence of electrode protection slots, the existing research on the assembly of cylindrical or polygonal pegs and holes may not be applicable to the assembly of such components. To this end, this article proposes a novel robotic assembly strategy for CECs with small relative initial deviations, whose core is to design a search trajectory and heuristic force strategy to perceive force/pose (F/P) discontinuity characteristics under different geometric constraints. This assembly strategy is independent of the CEC's size and is not affected by the socket's spatial orientation.

To this end, agricultural robots equipped with vision-based systems offer the potential to detect individual plants in the field automatically. This capability enables targeted management actions in the field, effectively reducing the amount of agrochemicals. A primary target of such vision systems is to perform a panoptic segmentation, combining the task of semantic and instance segmentation. Recent methods use neural networks for this task, which typically have to be trained on densely annotated images containing the required ground truth information for each pixel. Gathering these dense annotations is generally daunting and requires domain experts' knowledge in the agricultural domain.

These partial annotations contain ground truth information only for a subset of pixels per image and are thus much faster to obtain than dense annotations.

We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed a current state-of-the-art baseline and our ablations. Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84%, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80%, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.

Diffusion for Manipulation,ProDapt: Proprioceptive Adaptation Using Long-Term Memory Diffusion,"Pizarro Bejarano, Federico;Jones, Bryson;Pastor, Daniel;Bowkett, Joseph;Schoellig, Angela P.;Backes, Paul","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Imitation Learning, Space Robotics and Automation","Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized imitation learning, allowing robots to replicate complex behaviours. However, diffusion often relies on cameras and other exteroceptive sensors to observe the environment and lacks long-term memory. In space, military, and underwater applications, robots must be highly robust to failures in exteroceptive sensors, operating using only proprioceptive information. In this paper, we propose ProDapt, a method of incorporating long-term memory of previous contacts between the robot and the environment in the diffusion process, allowing it to complete tasks using only proprioceptive data. This is achieved by identifying ""keypoints"", essential past observations maintained as inputs to the policy. We test our approach using a UR10e robotic arm in both simulation and real experiments and demonstrate the necessity of this long-term memory for task completion.",,,,,,

Our method leverages a pretrained conditional diffusion model with Preference Latent Embeddings (PLE), trained on a large, reward-free offline dataset. The PLE serves as a compact representation for capturing specific user preferences. By adapting the pretrained model using our proposed preference inversion method, which directly optimizes the learnable PLE, we achieve superior alignment with human preferences compared to existing solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). To better reflect practical applications, we create a benchmark experiment using real human preferences on diverse, optimal trajectories.",,,,,,

In this work, we explore their application to end-to-end navigation -- including both perception and planning -- by considering the problem of jointly performing global localization and path planning in known but arbitrary 2D environments. In particular, we introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end localization and planning stack.",,,,,,
Diffusion for Manipulation,Diverse Motion Planning with Stein Diffusion Trajectory Inference,"Zeya, Yin;Lai, Tin;Barcelos, Lucas;Jacob, Jayadeep;Li, Yong Hui;Ramos, Fabio","Keywords: Probabilistic Inference, Integrated Planning and Learning","Abstract: Acquiring prior knowledge of trajectory distributions in specific environments can significantly expedite the optimisation process in robot motion planning. Leveraging successful past plans and utilising trajectory generative models as priors offers a clear advantage. Previous studies have proposed various methods to harness these priors, such as using prior samples for initialisation or incorporating the prior distribution into trajectory optimisation through inference. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in encoding multimodal data in high-dimensional settings. In this study, we propose a method that uses diffusion models as priors and employs Stein variational inference with Gaussian Process trajectories to integrate them into a batch inverse denoising process. This approach reduces the computation time required to approximate the posterior distribution of trajectories, particularly when adapting to new, unseen environments. Additionally, we incorporate path signatures into our method to enhance the diversity of the posterior distribution. To validate our approach, we conduct comparative assessments against multiple baseline methods across various scenarios, including 2D planar robots and robotic manipulators. Our experiments demonstrate that our method identifies the optimal solution with significantly reduced computational time.",,,,,,
Diffusion for Manipulation,The Ingredients for Robotic Diffusion Transformers,"Dasari, Sudeep;Mees, Oier;Zhao, Sebastian;Srirama, Mohan Kumar;Levine, Sergey","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Learning from Demonstration, Deep Learning in Grasping and Manipulation","Abstract: In recent years roboticists have achieved remarkable progress in solving increasingly general tasks on dexterous robotic hardware by leveraging high capacity Transformer network architectures and generative diffusion models. Unfortunately, combining these two orthogonal improvements has proven surprisingly difficult, since there is no clear and well understood process for making important design choices. In this paper, we identify, study and improve key architectural design decisions for high-capacity diffusion transformer policies. The resulting models can efficiently solve diverse tasks on multiple robot embodiments, without the excruciating pain of per-setup hyper-parameter tuning. By combining the results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are able to present a novel architecture, named DiT-Block Policy, that significantly outperforms the state of the art in solving long-horizon (1500+ time-steps) dexterous tasks on a bi-manual ALOHA robot. In addition, we find that our policies show improved scaling performance when trained on 10 hours of highly multi-modal, language annotated ALOHA demonstration data. We hope this work will open the door for future robot learning techniques that leverage the efficiency of generative diffusion modeling with the scalability of large scale transformer architectures.

Diffusion for Manipulation,Inference-Time Policy Steering through Human Interactions,"Wang, Yanwei;Wang, Lirui;Du, Yilun;Sundaralingam, Balakumar;Yang, Xuning;Chao, Yu-Wei;PÃ©rez-D'Arpino, Claudia;Fox, Dieter;Shah, Julie A.","Keywords: Imitation Learning, Human-Robot Collaboration, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

Legible robot motion is typically generated using hand-designed cost functions and classical motion planners. However, with the rise of deep learning and data-driven robot policies, we need methods for training end-to-end on offline demonstration data. In this paper, we propose Legibility Diffuser, a diffusion-based policy that learns intent expressive motion directly from human demonstrations. By variably combining the noise predictions from a goal-conditioned diffusion model, we guide the robot's motion toward the most legible trajectory in the training dataset. We find that decaying the guidance weight over the course of the trajectory is critical for maintaining a high success rate while maximizing legibility.",,,,,,

To address these issues, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline that automatically augments expert demonstrations with failure recovery trajectories and fine-grained language annotations for training. We then introduce Rich languAge-guided failure reCovERy (RACER), a supervisor-actor framework, which combines failure recovery data with rich language descriptions to enhance robot control. RACER features a vision-language model (VLM) that acts as an online supervisor, providing detailed language guidance for error correction and task execution, and a language-conditioned visuomotor policy as an actor to predict the next actions.

However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods for human-robot translation either depend on paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically pairs human and robot trajectories using sequence-level optimal transport cost functions. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent human videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon human clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. RHyME successfully imitates a range of cross-embodiment demonstrators, both in simulation and with a real human hand, achieving over 50% increase in task success compared to previous methods.

In this paper, we explore how to further improve these VLA models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), a commonly used fine-tuning technique for large models. However, we find that directly applying online RL to large VLA models presents significant challenges, including training instability that severely impacts the performance of large models, and computing demands that exceed the capabilities of most local machines. To address these problems, we propose iRe-VLA framework, which iterates between Reinforcement Learning and supervised learning to effectively improve VLA models, leveraging the exploratory benefits of RL while maintaining the stability of supervised learning.

However, these approaches not only suffer from compounding error issues but also require human experts to provide complete trajectories. Although there exist interactive methods where an expert oversees the robot and intervenes if needed, these extensions usually only utilize the data collected during intervention periods and ignore the feedback signal hidden in non-intervention timesteps. In this work, we create a model to formulate how the interventions occur in such cases, and show that it is possible to learn a policy with just a handful of expert interventions. Our key insight is that it is possible to get crucial information about the quality of the current state and the optimality of the chosen action from expert feedback, regardless of the presence or the absence of intervention.

Recent strides in representation learning have empowered vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments, thereby facilitating the integration of learning-based planning strategies. Among these approaches, Imitation Learning stands out due to its notable training efficiency. However, traditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated with the covariate shift phenomenon. We propose Validity Learning on Failures, VL(on failure), as a remedy to address this issue. The essence of our method lies in deploying a pre-trained planner across diverse scenarios. Instances where the planner deviates from its immediate objectives, such as maintaining a safe distance from obstacles or adhering to traffic rules, are flagged as failures. The states corresponding to these failures are compiled into a new dataset, termed the failure dataset. Notably, the absence of expert annotations for this data precludes the applicability of standard imitation learning approaches. To facilitate learning from the closed-loop mistakes, we introduce the VL objective which aims to discern valid trajectories within the current environmental context. Experimental evaluations conducted on both reactive CARLA simulation and non-reactive log-replay simulations reveal substantial enhancements in closed-loop metrics such as Score, Progress, and Success Rate, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Further evaluations against the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate that VL(on failure) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",,,,,,

Supplementing annotated waypoints with natural language guidance affords an opportunity for both. In this work we investigate one-shot versus iterative input, introducing a testbed system based on government and industry UAV planning tools that affords inputs in the form of both natural language text and drawn annotations on a terrain map. The testbed uses an LLM-based subsystem to map user inputs into additional terms for the trajectory optimization objective function.

Thermal images can provide complementary information to RGB images, so many recent semantic segmentation networks have been proposed using RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) images. However, most existing networks focus only on improving segmentation accuracy for single image frames, omitting the information consistency between consecutive frames. To provide a solution to this issue, we propose a temporal-consistent framework for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which introduces a virtual view image generation module to synthesize a virtual image for the next moment, and a consistency loss function to ensure the segmentation consistency. We also propose an evaluation metric to measure both the accuracy and consistency for semantic segmentation. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,

We present SaViD, a novel framework comprised of a three-stage fusion alignment mechanism designed to address long-range detection challenges in the presence of natural corruption. The SaViD framework consists of three key elements: the Global Memory Attention Network (GMAN), which enhances the extraction of image features through offering a deeper understanding of global patterns; the Attentional Sparse Memory Network (ASMN), which enhances the integration of LiDAR and image features; and the KNNnectivity Graph Fusion (KGF), which enables the entire fusion of spatial information.

However, previous models only performed feature fusion in the deep-level BEV hierarchy when dealing with camera-LiDAR feature fusion. This approach lacks interaction with the shallow-level sensor features, which is beneficial in constructing the corresponding BEV features. However, a simple shallow-level feature interaction can introduce sensor noise caused by intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration errors. To address this, we propose RoBiFusion, a novel camera-LiDAR 3D object detection framework designed for effective sensor feature interaction and mitigating sensor noise interference. This framework consists of three submodules: the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, the LiDAR-to-Camera module, and the Camera-to-LiDAR module. Firstly, in the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, we use the cross-attention module to dynamically match the camera features and the LiDAR features, which solves the problem of feature inconsistency caused by noise in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Secondly, in the LiDAR-to-Camera module, we propose a novel depth representation that can effectively mitigate LiDAR noise interference. Thirdly, in the Camera-to-LiDAR module, we introduce deformable attention to help LiDAR feature capture instance-level semantic features. Additionally, we design a novel differentiable and efficient grid sample module to accelerate the process since the bilinear grid sample module in deformable attention is time-consuming and not deployment-friendly.

It plays a pivotal role in 3D scene comprehension and holds great potential for various applications, such as robotic vision perception and autonomous driving. Many previous works leverage planar-based representations like BirdÂ’s Eye View (BEV) and Tri-Perspective View (TPV), which aim to simplify the complexity of 3D scenes while preserving essential object information, thereby facilitating efficient scene representation. However, in dense indoor environments where occlusions are prevalent, directly applying these planar-based methods often leads to difficulties in capturing global semantic occupancy, ultimately degrading model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel vertical slice representation, which divides the scene along the vertical axis and projects spatial point features onto the nearest pair of parallel planes. To harness these slice features, we propose SliceOcc, a camera-based model specifically tailored for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction. SliceOcc utilizes pairs of slice queries and cross-attention mechanisms to extract planar features from input images. These local planar features are then combined to form a global scene representation, which is employed for indoor occupancy estimation.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach of bandwidth-adaptive spatiotemporal CoID for collaborative perception, where robots interactively select partial spatiotemporal observations to share with others, while adapting to the communication constraint that dynamically changes over time. We evaluate our approach over various scenarios in connected autonomous driving simulations. Experimental results have demonstrated that our approach enables CoID and adapts to the dynamic change of bandwidth constraints. In addition, our approach achieves 8%-56% overall improvements in terms of covisible object retrieval for CoID and data sharing efficiency, which outperforms the previous techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Visual Perception and Learning,Polyp-Gen: Realistic and Diverse Polyp Image Generation for Endoscopic Dataset Expansion,"Liu, Shengyuan;Chen, Zhen;Yang, Qiushi;Yu, Weihao;Dong, Di;Hu, Jiancong;Yuan, Yixuan","Keywords: Computer Vision for Automation, Medical Robots and Systems, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Automated diagnostic systems (ADS) have shown significant potential in the early detection of polyps during endoscopic examinations, thereby reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/Polyp-Gen.",,,,,,

Most existing methods focus on 1) real-time reconstruction, 2) accurate voxel featuring learning, and 3) effective voxel sparsification algorithm. To this end, 1) they adopt a coarse-to-fine pipeline, where all non-empty voxels are sent to the next level for refinement. However, this results in over-refinement of flat regions, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, 2) advanced methods focus on exploring view visibility but overlook the discriminability among visible views, which limits the representation of learned voxel features. Moreover, 3) existing sparsification algorithms struggle to distinguish detailed and empty voxels, resulting in either the loss of detailed voxels or the retention of empty voxels. To tackle these challenges, 1) we present Dynamic Detail Refinement (DDR) to allocate more voxels to detailed regions for refinement, which could alleviate the computational burden. Furthermore, 2) we propose Discriminability-Aware Fusion (DAF) to focus on discriminative views, which helps to capture accurate voxel features. In addition, 3) we propose Hierarchical Hybrid Sparsification (HHS) to balance global completeness and local refinement, which helps to preserve detailed voxels at hierarchical levels effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the representative ScanNet (V2) and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",,,,,,
Visual Perception and Learning,DAP-LED: Learning Degradation-Aware Priors with CLIP for Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Deblurring,"Wang, Ling;Wu, Chen;Wang, Lin","Keywords: Visual Learning, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots often struggle with reliable visual perception at night due to the low illumination and motion blur caused by the long exposure time of RGB cameras. Existing methods address this challenge by sequentially connecting the off-the-shelf pretrained low-light enhancement and deblurring models. Unfortunately, these methods often lead to noticeable artifacts (eg., color distortions) in the over-exposed regions or make it hardly possible to learn the motion cues of the dark regions. In this paper, we interestingly find vision-language models, eg., Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), can comprehensively perceive diverse degradation levels at night. In light of this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint learning framework, named DAP-LED, which can jointly achieve low-light enhancement and deblurring, benefiting downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, segmentation, and detection in the dark. The key insight is to leverage CLIP to adaptively learn the degradation levels from images at night. This subtly enables learning rich semantic information and visual representation for optimization of the joint tasks. To achieve this, we first introduce a CLIP-guided cross-fusion module to obtain multi-scale patch-wise degradation heatmaps from the image embeddings. Then, the heatmaps are fused via the designed CLIP-enhanced transformer blocks to retain useful degradation information for effective model optimization. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our DAP-LED achieves state-of-the-art performance in the dark. Meanwhile, the enhanced results are demonstrated to be effective for three downstream tasks.

(ii) How can robots strategically select touch points on the object using geometric and common-sense priors? (iii) How can partial observations such as tactile signals improve the overall representation of the object?

Constructing a map by centralized processing of the robot observations is undesirable because it creates a single point of failure and requires pre-existing infrastructure and significant communication throughput. This paper formulates multi-robot object SLAM as a variational inference problem over a communication graph subject to consensus constraints on the object estimates maintained by different robots. To solve the problem, we develop a distributed mirror descent algorithm with regularization enforcing consensus among the communicating robots. Using Gaussian distributions in the algorithm, we also derive a distributed multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) for multi-robot object SLAM.

Multi-Robot SLAM and Mapping,TCAFF: Temporal Consistency for Robot Frame Alignment,"Peterson, Mason B.;Lusk, Parker C.;Avila, Antonio;How, Jonathan","Keywords: Localization, Multi-Robot SLAM","Abstract: In the field of collaborative robotics, the ability to communicate spatial information like planned trajectories and shared environment information is crucial. When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization.

Initially, the chance constrained obstacle-aware Voronoi cell (CCOVC) for each pursuer is constructed by calculating separation hyperplane and buffer terms. Subsequently, we formulate chance CBF and chance Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) constraints, using convex approximation to determine their upper bounds.

Trivial and repeatable tasks; e.g., sample transportation for analysis and vial capping are well-suited for robots; if done successfully and reliably, chemists could contribute their efforts towards more critical research activities. Currently, robots can perform these tasks faster than chemists, but how reliable are they? Improper capping could result in human exposure to toxic chemicals which could be fatal. To ensure that robots perform these tasks as accurately as humans, sensory feedback is required to assess the progress of task execution. To address this, we propose a novel methodology based on behaviour trees with multimodal perception. Along with automating robotic tasks, this methodology also verifies the successful execution of the task, a fundamental requirement in safety-critical environments. The experimental evaluation was conducted on two lab tasks: sample vial capping and laboratory rack insertion. The results show high success rate, i.e., 88% for capping and 92% for insertion, along with strong error detection capabilities.

This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes a hierarchical graph to represent the environment, encoding both geometric and semantic traversability. The framework enables the robots to compute a shared confidence metric, which helps the ground robot assess terrain and determine when deploying the aerial robot will extend exploration. The robot's confidence in traversing a path is based on factors such as predicted volumetric gain, path traversability, and collision risk. A hierarchy of graphs is used to maintain an efficient representation of traversability and frontier information through multi-resolution maps. Evaluated in a real subterranean exploration scenario, the approach allows the ground robot to autonomously identify zones that are no longer traversable but suitable for aerial deployment. By leveraging this hierarchical structure, the ground robot can selectively share graph information on confidence-assessed frontier targets from parts of the scene, enabling the aerial robot to navigate beyond obstacles and continue exploration.",,,,,,

Achieving certification for sterilization requires precise, repetitive execution with strict tolerances. In this study, we propose a framework that automates the handling and storage of endoscopes right after the sterilization process and employs compliant collaborative robots to address these dexterous manipulation challenges.

For instance, silk moths adjust their wing-flapping frequency to detect pheromones, while dogs modify their sniffing behavior by altering sniff height and frequency based on proximity to an odor source. Despite the potential to enhance odor detection for olfactory navigation by drawing inspiration from these natural mechanisms, many existing approaches focus on computationally intensive methods like multi-sensory integration or rely on multiple robots for odor localization, rather than leveraging embodied sensing. In this study, we propose an embodied adaptive sensing strategy that enhances odor detection by implementing an active odor sensor on a legged robot and applying a bio-inspired adaptive robot height control system for dynamically adapting the robot's height based on real-time gas concentration feedback. The control system employs a simple artificial hormone mechanism to regulate the robot height by processing gas concentration derivatives, mimicking biological adaptability. By utilizing the interaction between the active odor sensor, adaptive control system, and the legged body, this approach allows the robot to optimize its height online to capture the maximum gas concentration, thereby reducing the need for complex algorithms and high computational resources. As a result, it offers a more efficient solution for odor-driven tasks, with potential applications in real-world environments.",,,,,,

The majority of legged animals and robots are bilaterally symmetric, which facilitates locomotion with consistent headings and obstacle traversal, but leads to constraints in their turning ability. On the other hand, radially symmetric animals have demonstrated rapid turning abilities enabled by their omni-directional body plans. Radially symmetric tripedal robots are able to turn instantaneously, but are commonly constrained by needing to change direction with every step, resulting in inefficient and less stable locomotion. Inspired by the radial symmetry and maneuverability of brittle stars and octopuses, we introduce a novel design for a tripedal robot that has both frictional and rolling contacts. Additionally, a freely rotating central sphere provides an added contact point so the robot can retain a stable tripod base of support while lifting and pushing with any one of its legs.

The framework consists of a policy trained with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to modulate the parameters of a system of abstract oscillators (i.e. Central Pattern Generator), whose output is mapped to joint commands through a pattern formation layer that sets the gait style, i.e. body height, swing foot ground clearance height, and foot offset. Different gaits are formed by changing the coupling between different oscillators, which can be instantaneously selected at any velocity by a user. With this framework, we systematically investigate which gait should be used at which velocity, and when gait transitions should occur from a Cost of Transport (COT), i.e. energy-efficiency, point of view. Additionally, we note how gait style changes as a function of locomotion speed for each gait to keep the most energy-efficient locomotion. While the currently most popular gait (trot) does not result in the lowest COT, we find that considering different co-dependent metrics such as mean base angular velocity and joint acceleration result in different 'optimal' gaits than those that minimize COT. We deploy our controller in various hardware experiments, focusing on 9 quadruped animal gaits, and demonstrate generalizability to novel and unseen gaits during training, and robustness to leg failures.",,,,,,

To develop effective underwater and swimming vehicles, a wide range of bioinspired drag-based paddles have been proposed, often faced with a trade-off between propulsive efficiency and versatility. Webbed feet provide an effective propulsive force in the power phase, are light weight and robust, and can even be partially folded away in the recovery phase. However, during the transition between recovery and power phase, much time is lost folding and unfolding, leading to drag and reducing efficiency. In this work, we took inspiration from the coupling tendons of aquatic birds and utilized tendon coupling mechanisms to shorten the transition time between recovery and power phase. Results from our hardware experiments show that the proposed mechanisms improve propulsive efficiency by 2.0 and 2.4 times compared to a design without extensor tendons or based on passive paddle, respectively. We further report that distal leg joint clutching, which has been shown to improve efficiency in terrestrial walking, did not play an major role in swimming locomotion. In sum, we describe a new principle for an efficient, drag-based leg and paddle design, with potential relevance for the swimming mechanics in aquatic birds.",,,,,,

Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down hill slopes, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200%. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates.",,,,,,

Learning for Legged Locomotion 2,RINA: Rapid Introspective Neural Adaptation for Out-Of-Distribution Payload Configurations on Quadruped Robots,"Youngquist, Oscar;Zhang, Hao","Keywords: Machine Learning for Robot Control, Legged Robots, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Adaptive locomotion is a fundamental capability for quadruped robots, particularly in real-world scenarios when they must transport novel or out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) payloads across diverse terrains. Previous learning-based methods often tightly couple a locomotion controller's learned parameters with the adaptation process, which requires extensive pre-training or slow online updates when encountering O.O.D. payloads. To enable adaptation of quadruped locomotion to O.O.D. payloads, we propose the novel Rapid Introspective Neural Adaptation (RINA) method that rapidly compensates for differences between expected and actual joint torques caused by O.O.D. payloads. RINA introduces an adaptive residual dynamics representation that decouples the learning model's parameters from those used for adaptation. A new neural operator network is introduced to learn a set of basis functions as the learning model, which are combined using linear coefficients to predict residual dynamics. Then, these residual dynamics are used to adjust the locomotion controller's output, compensating for additional torques induced by the O.O.D. payload. During execution, the mixing coefficients can be rapidly and introspectively adapted on-the-go to generate joint torque compensations for O.O.D. payloads, while keeping the learned basis functions unchanged. Experimental results have demonstrated that our RINA approach well addresses on-the-go O.O.D. payload adaptation on varied natural terrains without collecting and retraining on additional data and outperforms baseline methods.",,,,,,

Compact, low-cost sensing platforms can facilitate a change, but unlike their popular optical counterparts, they are difficult to deploy in high-fidelity tasks due to their low signal dimensionality and lack of a simulation model. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PseudoTouch which links high-dimensional structural information to low-dimensional sensor signals. It does so by learning a low-dimensional visual-tactile embedding, wherein we encode a depth patch from which we decode the tactile signal. We collect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and visual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric shapes. We demonstrate the utility of our trained PseudoTouch model in two downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the object recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a set of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using PseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten touches, surpassing a proprioception baseline.

SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos.

Deep Learning Applications,Automated Generation of Transformations to Mitigate Sensor Hardware Migration in ADS,"Von Stein, Meriel;Elbaum, Sebastian;Wang, Hongning","Keywords: Sensor-based Control, Deep Learning Methods, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation","Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on massive amounts of sensed data to train their underlying machine-learned components. Common sensor hardware migrations can render an existing machine-learned pipeline inadequate. This necessitates the development of bespoke transformations to adapt new sensor data to the old learned model, or the retraining of a new model with new sensor data. These solutions are expensive, often performed reactively to sensor hardware migration, and rely on empirical reconstruction and validation metrics only which lack knowledge of the features important to the learned model. To address these challenges, we propose PreFixer, a technique that can systematically generate transformations for many types of sensor hardware migration during the ADS development lifecycle. PreFixer collects small datasets using colocated new and old sensors, and then uses that data and the output of the learned model to train an augmented encoder to learn a transformation that maps new sensor data to old sensor data. The trained encoder can then be deployed as a preprocessor to the old learned model. Our study shows that, for a common set of camera sensor hardware migrations, PreFixer can match or improve the performance of the best-performing baseline technique in terms of distance travelled safely with 10% of the training dataset, and take at most half of the training time.",,,,,,
Deep Learning Applications,Probabilistic Latent Variable Modeling for Dynamic Friction Identification and Estimation,"Vantilborgh, Victor;De Witte, Sander;Ostyn, Frederik;Lefebvre, Tom;Crevecoeur, Guillaume","Keywords: Industrial Robots, Deep Learning Methods, Probabilistic Inference","Abstract: Precise identification of dynamic models in robotics is essential to support dynamic simulations, control design, friction compensation, output torque estimation, etc. A longstanding challenge remains in the development and identification of friction models for robotic joints, given the numerous physical phenomena affecting the underlying friction dynamics which result into nonlinear characteristics and hysteresis behaviour in particular. These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and captured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated researchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these methods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical industrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity operations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate the use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to establish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for unidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The friction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional information encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We cast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a standard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the friction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks and are integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The complete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements in the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters.

Existing methods mitigate the performance impact by introducing semi-online settings with look-ahead or buffer zones. However, these methods either fail to fundamentally alter the packing order or reduce packing efficiency. This paper proposes a novel semi-online setting that allows for the observation of multiple items and the selection of one for packing, thereby adjusting the packing order without reducing packing efficiency. We do work for solving the semi-online packing problem via reinforcement learning which faces two real-world challenges: (1) a variable and difficult-to-predict number of observed items, and (2) the obstruction of robotic arm movement by already packed items. On the one hand, we design a policy network capable of adapting to variable item quantities. On the other hand, we introduce a guided bottom-up packing reward function to free up space for robotic arm motion. We show that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of space utilization with the condition of observing at least two items.

Firstly, we decompose the robot's SDF using forward kinematics and leverage multiple extremely lightweight networks in parallel to efficiently approximate the SDF. Moreover, we introduce support vector machines to integrate the self-collision detection module into the framework, which we refer to as the SDF-SC framework. Using statistical features, our approach unifies the representation of collision distance for both SDF and self-collision detection. During this process, we maintain and utilize the differentiable properties of the framework to optimize collision-free robot trajectories. Finally, we develop a reactive motion controller based on our framework, enabling real-time avoidance of multiple dynamic obstacles. While maintaining high accuracy, our framework achieves inference speeds up to five times faster than previous methods. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,,,
Collision Avoidance 2,Differentiable Composite Neural Signed Distance Fields for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Indoor Environments,"Bukhari, Syed Talha;Lawson, Daniel;Qureshi, Ahmed H.","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, RGB-D Perception","Abstract: Neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) provide a differentiable environment representation to readily obtain collision checks and well-defined gradients for robot navigation tasks. However, updating neural SDFs as the scene evolves entails re-training, which is tedious, time consuming, and inefficient, making it unsuitable for robot navigation with limited field-of-view in dynamic environments. Towards this objective, we propose a compositional framework of neural SDFs to solve robot navigation in indoor environments using only an onboard RGB-D sensor. Our framework embodies a dual mode procedure for trajectory optimization, with different modes using complementary methods of modeling collision costs and collision avoidance gradients. The primary stage queries the robot body's SDF, swept along the route to goal, at the obstacle point cloud, enabling swift local optimization of trajectories. The secondary stage infers the visible scene's SDF by aligning and composing the SDF representations of its constituents, providing better informed costs and gradients for trajectory optimization. The dual mode procedure combines the best of both stages, achieving a success rate of 98%, 14.4% higher than baseline with comparable amortized plan time on iGibson 2.0. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to real-world indoor scenarios.",,,,,,
Collision Avoidance 2,On the Evaluation of Collision Probability Along a Path,"Paiola, Lorenzo;Grioli, Giorgio;Bicchi, Antonio","Keywords: Risk, Collision Avoidance, Probability and Statistical Methods, Robot Safety","Abstract: Characterizing the risk of operations is a fundamental requirement in robotics, and a crucial ingredient of safe planning. The problem is multifaceted, with multiple definitions arising in the vast recent literature fitting different application scenarios and leading to different computational approaches. A basic element shared by most frameworks is the definition and evaluation of the probability of collision for a mobile object in an environment with obstacles. We observe that, even in basic cases, different interpretations are possible. This paper proposes an index we call Risk Density, which offers a theoretical link between conceptually distant assumptions about the interplay of single collision events along a continuous path. We show how this index can be used to approximate the collision probability in the case where the robot evolves along a nominal continuous curve from random initial conditions. Indeed under this hypothesis the proposed approximation outperforms some well-established methods either in accuracy or computational cost.",,,,,,
Task and Motion Planning 4,Fast and Accurate Task Planning Using Neuro-Symbolic Language Models and Multi-Level Goal Decomposition,"Kwon, Minseo;Kim, Yaesol;Kim, Young J.","Keywords: Task Planning, Task and Motion Planning","Abstract: In robotic task planning, symbolic planners using rule-based representations like PDDL are effective but struggle with long-sequential tasks in complicated environments due to exponentially increasing search space. Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments.

A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates the Large Language Model (LLM) in performing self-questioning and answering, which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot.",,,,,,

Existing work uses LLMs to directly output task plans or generate goals in representations like PDDL. However, these methods fall short because they rely on the LLM to do the actual planning or output a hard-to-satisfy goal. Our approach instead extracts knowledge from an LLM in the form of plan schemas as an object-level representation called functional object-oriented networks (FOON), from which we automatically generate PDDL subgoals. Our method markedly outperforms alternative planning strategies in completing several pick-and-place tasks in simulation.",,,,,,

This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and outputs executable robot programs that incorporate insights into affordances. The process begins with GPT-4V analyzing the videos to obtain textual explanations of environmental and action details. A GPT-4-based task planner then encodes these details into a symbolic task plan. Subsequently, vision systems spatially and temporally ground the task plan in the videosÂ—objects are identified using an open-vocabulary object detector, and hand-object interactions are analyzed to pinpoint moments of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows for the gathering of affordance information (e.g., grasp types, waypoints, and body postures) critical for robot execution. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a one-shot manner. Meanwhile, quantitative tests have revealed instances of hallucination in GPT-4V, highlighting the importance of incorporating human supervision within the pipeline.

As such, in this work, we introduce a Capability-Level System for Tracking Robots (CLSTR), a new visualization for supporting operators to maintain an appropriate level of situational awareness over the capabilities of a dynamic robot team. In evaluating CLSTR through an online human-subject study (n=123), we found that a combination of different visual elements within an interface like the use of icons to summarize robot capabilities and animations to indicate team changes can help operators maintain awareness over robot teams.",,,,,,

To ensure safe and efficient operation, robots must optimize task performance while minimizing the penalties associated with NSEs, balancing individual objectives with collective impact. We model the problem of mitigating NSEs in a cooperative multi-agent system as a bi-objective lexicographic decentralized Markov decision process. We assume independence of transitions and rewards with respect to the robots' tasks, but the joint NSE penalty creates a form of dependence in this setting. To improve scalability, the joint NSE penalty is decomposed into individual penalties for each robot using credit assignment, which facilitates decentralized policy computation. We empirically demonstrate, using mobile robots and in simulation, the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in mitigating NSEs. Code: https://tinyurl.com/RECON-NSE-Mitigation",,,,,,

However, the network and cloud computing infrastructure are not designed for reliable timing guarantee, leading to fluctuating Quality-of-Service (QoS). In this work, we formulate an impossibility triangle of latency reliability, singleton deployment and commodity hardware. The theorem implicates that providing replicated resources with uncorrelated failures exponentially reduces the probability of missing a deadline. We present FogROS2-Probabilistic Latency Reliability (RLR) that uses multiple independent network interfaces to send requests to replicated cloud resources and uses the first response back. We design routing mechanisms to discover, connect, and route through non-default network interfaces on robots. FogROS2-PLR optimizes the selection of interfaces to servers by minimizing the probability of missing a deadline. We conduct a cloud-connected driving experiment with two 5G service providers, demonstrating FogROS2-PLR effectively provides smooth service quality even if one of the service providers experiences low coverage and base station handover. We use 99 Percentile (P99) latency to evaluate anomalous long-tail latency behavior. In the experiment, FogROS2-PLR improves P99 latency by up to 3.7x compared to using one service provider.

Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies.

Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention.

This is because they allow to deeply exploit the versatility of collaborative robots. In this context, dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) have become a standard method for enabling human operators to easily teach tasks to robots. However, DMPs have two main limitations. First, they may encounter difficulties in generalizing some tasks, which can lead to non-intuitive behavior. Second, it is not guaranteed that the output of DMPs is compliant with ISO/TS 15066, which provides guidelines for assessing safety in collaborative scenarios. This work aims to address these two issues by introducing a novel control pipeline. This pipeline leverages a new variant of DMPs, called Swap DMPs (SDMPs), introduced in this work. The SDMPs enable a more intuitive behavior when the robot reproduces the learned task. Subsequently, SDMPs are encoded into a new optimization problem that ensures the robot complies with the Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) collaborative mode. The proposed approach has been experimentally validated and compared with traditional DMPs in both simulation and a real scenario, where a UR5e and a human operator collaborate on a polishing task.",,,,,,

Physical Human-Robot Interaction,Leveraging Semantic and Geometric Information for Zero-Shot Robot-To-Human Handover,"Liu, Jiangshan;Dong, Wenlong;Wang, Jiankun;Meng, Max Q.-H.","Keywords: Physical Human-Robot Interaction, Robot Companions, Grasping","Abstract: Human-robot interaction (HRI) encompasses a wide range of collaborative tasks, with handover being one of the most fundamental. As robots become more integrated into human environments, the potential for service robots to assist in handing objects to humans is increasingly promising. In robot-to-human (R2H) handover, selecting the optimal grasp is crucial for success, as it requires avoiding interference with the human's preferred grasp region and minimizing intrusion into their workspace. Existing methods either inadequately consider geometric information or rely on data-driven approaches, which often struggle to generalize across diverse objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot system that combines semantic and geometric information to generate optimal handover grasps. Our method first identifies grasp regions using semantic knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and, by incorporating customized visual prompts, achieves finer granularity in region grounding. A grasp is then selected based on grasp distance and approach angle to maximize human ease and avoid interference. We validate our approach through ablation studies and real-world comparison experiments. Results demonstrate that our system improves handover success rates and provides a more user-preferred interaction experience.

The developed control system enables the AMR to navigate to a specific person and grasp the object that the person wants to handover. This paper proposes a motion planning algorithm for grasping an unseen object held in hand. Through hand detection and segmentation, the hand region is masked and removed from the acquired depth image, which is used to estimate the object pose for grasping. For grasp pose determination, we propose to add the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to the Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) model to enhance the recognition rate. For the object-grasp task, the AMR localizes the object in personÂ’s hand, and uses the Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based controller to simultaneously control the mobile base and manipulator to grasp the object.

Motion Control 2,Optimize and Coordinate Multiple DMPs under Constraints to Achieve a Collaborative Manipulation Task,"Kordia, Ali H.;Melo, Francisco S.","Keywords: Motion Control, Planning, Scheduling and Coordination, Human-Robot Collaboration","Abstract: This paper addresses a significant challenge in achieving collaborative tasks; how can a robot or multiple robots, endowed with a library of pre-learned primitive movements, generate multiple simultaneous coordinated robotic movements, adapting and optimizing those in the library, to complete one collaborative task? This work can thus be seen as a follow-up to the work with a motion presented as dynamic movement primitive (DMP) that now considers collaborative tasks and the existence of multiple robots/manipulators. Specifically, we start with a simple task using one DMP and extend it to accommodate the coordinated execution of multiple DMPs in robots with multiple manipulators or---alternatively---multiple robots with a single manipulator. We investigate mechanisms to jointly optimize multiple DMPs to perform one task in a coordinated fashion. The joint trajectory is built from initial DMPs learned for a single manipulator, and its optimization must comply with task-specific constraints. We illustrate the application of our approach both in a simulated environment and in a simulated and real Baxter robot.",,,,,,

This paper presents the H-robot, a self-designed microrobot featuring an innovative structure. The H-robot features a honeycomb porous spherical design specifically engineered to enhance cargo capacity. A new dynamic model for this structure has been developed for low Reynolds number fluid environments, along with a robust backstepping sliding mode control (RBSMC) strategy. Experiments were conducted in a calibrated magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator to achieve precise motion control. The results demonstrate that the H-robot accurately tracks standard trajectories, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.09Ã—10âˆ? m for the Number-8 path and 8.29Ã—10âˆ? m for the S-shaped path. Additionally, the proposed resistance model enhances tracking accuracy by 73.61% compared to traditional models, effectively adjusting the dynamic behavior of the H-robot in low Reynolds number fluids and significantly improving its motion performance. Finally, path planning experiments in a maze demonstrate the H-robotÂ’s ability to navigate and avoid obstacles.",,,,,,

Existing research predominantly focuses on explicit malicious attack patterns. Our work introduces a covert deception attack framework in the context of multi-agent resource scheduling scenarios. We first highlight vulnerabilities in scheduling strategies based on time and path costs. Exploiting these weaknesses, an infiltrated agent clandestinely gathers motion characteristics of other agents while posing as a teammate. Using these motion characteristics, the infiltrated agent employs an LSTM architecture to learn and predict congestion areas, thereby designing attack paths with greater time efficiency. This approach allows the infiltrated agent to secure additional resources and evade capture more effectively. Validation through simulation and real-world experiments demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, underscoring the importance of evaluating covert attacks in risk assessments within multi-agent systems.",,,,,,
Resiliency and Security 2,Early Model-Based Safety Analysis for Collaborative Robotic Systems (I),"Manjunath, Meenakshi;Jesus Raja, Jeshwitha;Daun, Marian","Keywords: Safety in HRI, Intelligent and Flexible Manufacturing, Modeling, Control, and Learning for Soft Robots","Abstract: The current era is marked by an accelerated digitization of manufacturing processes, with robotic systems increasingly integrated into various workflows. Yet, despite significant advancements, it is impractical to fully automate certain tasks due to prohibitive costs and technical constraints. As a result, thereÂ’s a growing emphasis on human-robot collaboration (HRC) for intricate operations. In HRC scenarios, humans and robots co-inhabit the same work environment, operating side by side. More than just mere coexistence in the same space, they actively collaborate on shared tasks, thus raising the stakes in terms of safety. The dynamic behavior of robots must be synchronized with the anticipated and unexpected human actions, adding another layer of complexity to the safety considerations. It is essential to conduct comprehensive safety analyses that identify potential risks that pose harm to the human operator. As a proactive measure to foster early-stage safety and risk analysis, we propose the use of goal models. The approach enables the specification of safety threats within the HRC context, thereby facilitating the development of safety tasks and supportive monitoring mechanisms. This approach helps in the refinement and implementation of safety measures, ensuring a secure and productive environment for human-robot collaboration.",,,,,,

Teleoperation, one of major applications in robotics, involves a leader manipulator operated by a human and a follower manipulator at a remote site, connected via a communication channel. While this setup enables operation in challenging environments, it also introduces cybersecurity risks, particularly in the communication link. The paper focuses on a specific class of cyberattacks: perfectly undetectable FDIAs, where attackers alter signals without leaving detectable traces at all. Compared to previous research on linear and first-order nonlinear systems, this paper examines bilateral teleoperation systems with second-order nonlinear manipulator dynamics. The paper derives mathematical conditions based on Lie Group theory that enable such attacks, demonstrating how an attacker can modify the follower manipulator's motion while the operator perceives normal operation through the leader device. This vulnerability challenges conventional detection methods based on observable changes and highlights the need for advanced security measures in teleoperation systems.

Hand and Gripper Design,A Novel Under-Actuated Gripper Based on Passive-Locking Mechanism for Stable Gripping under Environmental Constraints,"Yang, Seokjun;Lee, Sungon;Yang, Woosung","Keywords: Grippers and Other End-Effectors, Mechanism Design, Grasping","Abstract: This paper presents a novel under-actuated two finger gripper that passively adapts to various environments and maintains its grip posture using a passive-locking mechanism. The proposed mechanism features fingers with three phalanges, each incorporating four-bar and eight-bar linkages arranged in parallel. These linkages perform crucial functions, including maintaining the grip angle and ensuring passive characteristics during pinch grips. Previous grippers with passive mechanisms and three-phalanx fingers faced issues with gripping instability, particularly when changes in the passive joint angle were caused by object inertia or external lateral forces. To address this problem, we propose a new passive-locking mechanism utilizing an eight-bar linkage. This innovative design is engineered to adapt to environmental conditions, establish a secure grip, and maintain the grip angle of the passive joint after the grip is achieved. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed mechanism, this paper conducts a fingertip force vector analysis and a mobility analysis according to the pinch sequence. It also details the derivation process and principles of the mechanism. The gripperÂ’s operational range and gripping force are examined through kinematic analysis and verified by simulation. Furthermore, the study shows that the proposed mechanism effectively responds to environmental constraints, even in environments with obstacles surrounding the object. Comparative experiments with and without a contact bar indicate that the proposed gripper can stably secure an object in scenarios involving swing motions and external forces of approximately 5N.",,,,,,

The gripper increases its grasp ability by changing its finger posture and firmness suitable for given target objects. In the proposed gripper, each finger is constructed by serially connecting multiple Juzu units. By controlling the angles between neighboring Juzu units individually using two actuators used for sending and bending, arbitrary finger shapes can be generated. In addition, by controlling the tension of the wire that penetrated all Juzu units in each finger, the friction between Juzu units is adjusted and the firmness of finger can be varied.

Hand and Gripper Design,A Direct-Drive Gripper Designed by Ellipse Synthesis across Two Output Modes,"Ramesh, Shashank;Plecnik, Mark","Keywords: Mechanism Design, Grippers and Other End-Effectors, Kinematics","Abstract: There are many ways for a gripper to estimate the forces between its fingers. If powered by direct-drive brushless motors, then one technique is to measure their current. This is not the most accurate technique, but it is simple, keeps the sensor remote, and requires no new components. The estimation involves multiplying current signals through by the torque constant and the inverse transpose of the Jacobian. The Jacobian either amplifies the signal from fingertip force to motor current (at the cost of tip force production), or diminishes it (with the gain of tip force production), indicating an inherent trade-off. However, the Jacobian is a function of configuration, and for any workspace point there are multiple configurations (multiple inverse kinematics solutions), therefore a selection of Jacobian exists. For a given workspace point, the number of Jacobian choices is just a few, but these choices can be designed (through dimensional synthesis) to overcome the trade-off. The problem can be framed as velocity ellipse synthesis over multiple output modes. In this work, we conduct optimal synthesis to compute a new gripper design. The gripper was built and tested. It transitions between two different modes: sense mode and grip mode. Sense mode can sense forces 3 times smaller than grip mode. Grip mode can exert forces 4 times greater than sense mode.",,,,,,

The proposed gripper is most effective for retrieving objects from deformable environments, such as taking an object out of a drawstring bag, or for extracting target objects located behind surrounding objects. The proposed gripper achieves both work-space expansion and grasping motion by using only a single motor. The gripper is equipped with four outer fingers for expanding the environment and two inner fingers for grasping an object. The inner and outer fingers move in different directions for their respective functions of grasping and spatial expansion.

Some tasks require recognizing objects far from the robot's camera. A challenging example is Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) in human-robot interaction where the user exhibits directive gestures at a distance of up to 25~m from the robot. However, training a model to recognize hardly visible objects located in ultra-range requires an exhaustive collection of a significant amount of labeled samples. The generation of synthetic training datasets is a recent solution to the lack of real-world data, while unable to properly replicate the realistic visual characteristics of distant objects in images. In this letter, we propose the Diffusion in Ultra-Range (DUR) framework based on a Diffusion model to generate labeled images of distant objects in various scenes. The DUR generator receives a desired distance and class (e.g., gesture) and outputs a corresponding synthetic image. We apply DUR to train a URGR model with directive gestures in which fine details of the gesturing hand are challenging to distinguish. DUR is compared to other types of generative models showcasing superiority both in fidelity and in recognition success rate when training a URGR model. More importantly, training a DUR model on a limited amount of real data and then using it to generate synthetic data for training a URGR model outperforms directly training the URGR model on real data.

However, existing algorithms for processing raw sensor inputs to useful intermediate signals such as contact patches struggle in high-deformation regimes. This is due to physical constraints imposed by sensor hardware and small-deformation assumptions used by mechanics-based models. In this work, we propose a fusion algorithm for proximity and visuotactile point clouds for contact patch segmentation, entirely independent from membrane mechanics. This algorithm exploits the synchronous, high spatial resolution proximity and visuotactile modalities enabled by an extremely deformable, selectively transmissive soft membrane, which uses visible light for visuotactile sensing and infrared light for proximity depth. We evaluate our contact patch algorithm in low (10%), medium (60%), and high (100%+) strain states.

Soft Sensors,Spatial Sensitivity Equalization of ERT-Based Robotic Skin through Gauge Factor Distribution Optimization,"Cho, Junhwi;Chung, Hyunjo;Park, Kyungseo;Kim, Jung","Keywords: Force and Tactile Sensing, Touch in HRI, Soft Sensors and Actuators","Abstract: Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) has emerged as a promising technology for large-area robotic skin due to its ability to reconstruct pressure distribution over extensive regions using a few sparsely distributed electrodes. Despite ERTÂ’s potential to reconstruct the external forces applied on 3D surfaces, the uneven distribution of spatial sensitivity leads to significant errors in identifying the physical quantities of contacts, inhibiting this technique from being an effective tactile sensor. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to equalize the spatial sensitivity by modulating the conductivity of ERT sensors through topology optimization. In a simulation environment, the sensor's conductive domain was converted into a binary image and optimized to equalize spatial sensitivity and reduce disparities between low and high-sensitivity areas.

Soft Sensors,Milli-Scale AcousTac Sensing Using Soft Helmholtz Resonators,"Aderibigbe, Jadesola;Li, Monica;Lee, Jungpyo;Stuart, Hannah","Keywords: Soft Sensors and Actuators, Force and Tactile Sensing, Soft Robot Applications","Abstract: Acoustic transmission, or sound, can effectively communicate information over distances through various media. We focus on generating acoustic transmission using pneumatically driven resonators for wireless tactile sensing without the need for any electronics at the end-effector or contact point. We explore the relationship between emitted frequency and the geometry of the resonance chamber. When a normal compressive force is applied to the end cap, the compliant resonant cavity deforms, leading to an increase in frequency measurable by an external microphone. Prior work uses tube resonators with fipple attachments. In the present work, we study whether a different smaller audible cylindrical resonator with air blown across the entryway can be utilized instead. We test the utility of the Helmholtz resonator model in predicting the experimental frequency response. Resonance is often modeled for rigid cavities, presenting unique challenges in predicting resonance for the design of soft resonating taxels.",,,,,,
Soft Sensors,Enhanced Model-Free Dynamic State Estimation for a Soft Robot Finger Using an Embedded Optical Waveguide Sensor,"Krauss, Henrik;Takemura, Kenjiro","Keywords: Modeling, Control, and Learning for Soft Robots, Soft Sensors and Actuators, Machine Learning for Robot Control","Abstract: In this letter, an advanced stretchable optical waveguide sensor is implemented into a multidirectional PneuNet soft actuator to enhance dynamic state estimation through a NARX neural network. The stretchable waveguide featuring a semidivided core design from previous work is sensitive to multiple strain modes. It is integrated into a soft finger actuator with two pressure chambers that replicates human finger motions. The soft finger, designed for applications in soft robotic grippers or hands, is viewed in isolation under pneumatic actuation controlled by motorized linear stages. The research first characterizes the soft finger's workspace and sensor response. Subsequently, three dynamic state estimators are developed using NARX architecture, differing in the degree of incorporating the optical waveguide sensor response. Evaluation on a testing path reveals that the full sensor response significantly improves end effector position estimation, reducing mean error by 51% from 5.70 mm to 2.80 mm, compared to only 21% improvement to 4.53 mm using the estimator representing a single core waveguide design. The letter concludes by discussing the application of these estimators for (open-loop) model-predictive control and recommends future focus on advanced, structured soft (optical) sensors for model-free state estimation and control of soft robots.",,,,,,
Design and Control,Efficient and Diverse Generative Robot Designs Using Evolution and Intrinsic Motivation,"Le Goff, Leni Kenneth;Smith, SimÃ³n C.","Keywords: Evolutionary Robotics, Methods and Tools for Robot System Design, Embodied Cognitive Science","Abstract: Methods for generative design of robot physical configurations can automatically find optimal and innovative solutions for challenging tasks in complex environments. The vast search-space includes the physical design-space and the controller parameter-space, making it a challenging problem in machine learning and optimisation in general. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promising results in generating robot designs via gradient-free optimisation. Morpho-evolution with learning (MEL) uses EAs to concurrently generate robot designs and learn the optimal parameters of the controllers. Two main issues prevent MEL from scaling to higher complexity tasks: i) computational cost and ii) premature convergence to sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, we propose combining morpho-evolution with intrinsic motivations. Intrinsically motivated behaviour arises from embodiment and simple learning rules without external guidance. We use a homeokinetic controller that generates exploratory behaviour in a few seconds with minimal knowledge of the robotÂ’s design. Homeokinesis replaces costly learning phases, reducing computational time and favouring diversity, preventing premature convergence. We compare our approach with current MEL methods in several downstream tasks. The generated designs score higher in all the tasks, are more diverse, and are quickly generated compared to morpho-evolution with static parameters.

Design and Control,A Novel Hybrid Hysteresis Modeling Method for Multiloop-Asymmetry Hysteresis Behavior of Nonlinear Compliant Actuators,"Zhou, Libo;Xu, Lingpeng;Ou, Linlin;Yu, Xinyi;Feng, Yalei;Bai, Shaoping","Keywords: Compliant Joints and Mechanisms, Prosthetics and Exoskeletons, Wearable Robotics","Abstract: Nonlinear compliant actuators are being increasingly used in human-robot interaction scenarios due to their inherent flexibility. However, a limitation is that nonlinear hysteresis exists, which will degrade the force/torque tracking performance if the hysteresis is not modeled accurately. Moreover, the existing methods are difficult to deal with the multi-loop asymmetry hysteresis. In this work, we present a novel modeling method, in which the hysteresis curves are decoupled into nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops. A hybrid hysteresis model based on power function and Maxwellslip model is then developed to fit the nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops respectively. Experiments were conducted on a nonlinear compliant actuator and the results show that the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) of the hysteresis model decreases by 24.4% when compared with the Maxwellslip based hysteresis model.",,,,,,

To address this, we derive a Koopman-based linearized model of the human-exoskeleton system using electromyography and ultrasound-derived metrics of volitional muscle activity during exoskeleton-assisted walking. Data are collected from one participant with spinal cord injury (SCI) and two participants with no disabilities. Various electromyography and ultrasound-derived features in addition to normalized motor currents are used to derive predictive models, and we identify which muscle activation metrics produce the most accurate model for each subject. For both subjects without disabilities, the most accurate model uses only ultrasound-derived echogenicity as a metric of muscle activity, while the most accurate model for the subject with SCI uses only EMG wave length. Furthermore, the inclusion of ground reaction force increases the prediction accuracy of all models for one participant with no disabilities while decreasing the accuracy of most models for the participant with SCI.

In this paper, we tackle such nonlinearities by enhancing a dynamic unicycle model with Gaussian Process (GP) regression outputs. This enables us to develop an adaptive, uncertainty-informed navigation formulation. We solve the resultant stochastic optimal control problem using a chance-constrained Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control method. This approach formulates obstacle avoidance and path-following as chance constraints, accounting for residual uncertainties from the GP to ensure safety and reliability in control. Leveraging GPU acceleration, we efficiently manage the non-convex nature of the problem, ensuring real-time performance. Our approach unifies path-following and obstacle avoidance across different terrains, unlike prior works which typically focus on one or the other. We compare our GP-MPPI method against unicycle and data-driven kinematic models within the MPPI framework. In simulations, our approach shows superior tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance. We further validate our approach through hardware experiments on a skid-steer robot platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in high-speed navigation.

Also, due to surface slipping at high speeds, the friction parameters may continually change (like tire degradation in autonomous racing), and the controller may need to adapt rapidly. Many works derive a task-specific robot model with a parameter adaptation scheme that works well for the task but requires a lot of effort and tuning for each platform and task. In this work, we design a full model-learning-based controller based on meta pre-training that can very quickly adapt using few-shot dynamics data to any wheel-based robot with any model parameters, while also reasoning about model uncertainty. We demonstrate our results in small-scale numeric simulation, the large-scale Unity simulator, and on a medium-scale hardware platform with a wide range of settings. We show that our results are comparable to domain-specific well-engineered controllers, and have excellent generalization performance across all scenarios",,,,,,

Planning under Uncertainty 3,A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction,"Li, Zhouheng;Zhou, Bei;Hu, Cheng;Xie, Lei;Su, Hongye","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Integrated Planning and Control, Constrained Motion Planning","Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits.

While traditional controllers based on tire models are reliable, they often demand extensive tuning or system identification. RL methods offer significant potential due to their ability to learn directly from interaction, yet they typically suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulation fail to perform effectively in the real world. In this paper, we propose RLPP, a residual RL framework that enhances a PP controller with an RL-based residual. This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37%, closing the gap to the SotA methods by more than 52% and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller.

Effective risk assessment helps AVs make decisions and avoid risks. However, existing methods face challenges due to environmental uncertainties, insufficient multi-dimensional risk quantification, and limited predictive accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic risk assessment framework that quantifies the risk of AVs violating safety constraints and calculates the expected average severity of such violations in uncertain environments. We first establish a general SOTIF risk model to characterize the static risk of the AV and surrounding traffic participants. Following this, we introduce a method for predicting dynamic uncertainty risks, resulting in probabilistic risk quantification. This framework accounts for multi-dimensional uncertainties and enhances safety under dynamic conditions. Extensive evaluations across typical traffic scenariosÂ—including highways, intersections, and roundaboutsÂ—demonstrate that our method outperforms typical algorithms like Time Headway (THW) and Time-to-Collision (TTC). Empirical studies in extreme scenarios further validate the framework's ability to reduce risks and improve system generalization.

While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, autonomous agents are incapable of rapidly reasoning about complex, potentially conflicting options, leading to suboptimal behaviors such as deadlocks. Recently, the nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) model has proven to exhibit fast opinion formation and avoidance of decision deadlocks. However, NOD modeling parameters are oftentimes assumed fixed, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments. It remains an open challenge to determine such parameters automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based and game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. We demonstrate Neural NODÂ’s ability to make fast and deadlock-free decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example.

This paper introduces an online graph-based local planning approach constrained by a user-defined driving style in terms of a risk budget Delta for the entire mission. Our online approach assigns a risk bound to each motion planning decision, ensuring that the total risk consumed remains within Delta. First, we construct a spatial lattice graph that adheres to the vehicle's curvature constraints. Then, the trajectory planning problem is reformulated as an online optimization problem, where decisions must be made sequentially without prior knowledge of future events. Therefore, we propose a reduction to the problem to be online multiple-choice knapsack problem (ON-MCKP), where the knapsack items are candidate paths generated by solving constrained shortest-path problems. To solve the ON-MCKP, we deploy online algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees on the risk allocation throughout the entire mission.

However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network using multi-agent reinforcement learning for time-optimal multi-drone flight.

To address these challenges, this study proposes heterogeneous kernel metrics for Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), designed to robustly capture the diverse driving policies of OVs, and carry out precise trajectory predictions along with the associated uncertainties. A key virtue of the proposed kernel metrics lies in their ability to align similar driving policies and disjoin dissimilar ones in an unsupervised manner, given the observed interactions between the Ego Vehicle (EV) and OVs. The efficacy of the proposed method is substantiated through experimental studies on a 1/10th scale racecar platform, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and thereby safely overtaking against OVs.

To address this limitation, this paper presents an occlusion-aware game-theoretic inference method to estimate the locations of potentially occluded agents, and simultaneously infer the intentions of both visible and occluded agents, which best accounts for the observations of visible agents. Additionally, we propose a receding horizon planning strategy based on an occlusion-aware contingency game designed to navigate in scenarios with potentially occluded agents. Monte Carlo simulations validate our approach, demonstrating that it accurately estimates the game model and trajectories for both visible and occluded agents using noisy observations of visible agents.

We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation of shape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.",,,,,,
Agricultural Automation 4,A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics,"Ngnepiepaye Wembe, Stephane;Rousseau, Vincent;Laconte, Johann;Lenain, Roland","Keywords: Agricultural Automation, Motion Control, Robotics and Automation in Agriculture and Forestry","Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionally, path-following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicleÂ’s center along a predefined trajectory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the tool itself rather than the vehicleÂ’s center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially intended for the rear axleÂ’s midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset point control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.",,,,,,
Agricultural Automation 4,Towards Over-Canopy Autonomous Navigation: Crop-Agnostic LiDAR-Based Crop-Row Detection in Arable Fields,"Liu, Ruiji;Yandun, Francisco;Kantor, George","Keywords: Agricultural Automation, Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning, Field Robots","Abstract: Autonomous navigation is crucial for various robotics applications in agriculture. However, many existing methods depend on RTK-GPS devices, which can be susceptible to loss of radio signal or intermittent reception of corrections from the internet. Consequently, research has increasingly focused on using RGB cameras for crop-row detection, though challenges persist when dealing with grown plants. This paper introduces a LiDAR-based navigation system that can achieve crop-agnostic over-canopy autonomous navigation in row-crop fields, even when the canopy fully blocks the inter-row spacing. Our algorithm can detect crop rows across diverse scenarios, encompassing various crop types, growth stages, illumination conditions, the presence of weeds, curved rows, and discontinuities. Without utilizing a global localization method (i.e., based on GPS), our navigation system can perform autonomous navigation in these challenging scenarios, detect the end of the crop rows, and navigate to the next crop row autonomously, providing a crop-agnostic approach to navigate an entire field. The proposed navigation system has undergone tests in various simulated and real agricultural fields, achieving an average cross-track error of 3.55 cm without human intervention. The system has been deployed on a customized UGV robot, which can be reconfigured depending on the field conditions.",,,,,,
Agricultural Automation 4,Safe Leaf Manipulation for Accurate Shape and Pose Estimation of Occluded Fruits,"Yao, Shaoxiong;Pan, Sicong;Bennewitz, Maren;Hauser, Kris",Keywords: Agricultural Automation,"Abstract: Fruit monitoring plays an important role in crop management, and rising global fruit consumption combined with labor shortages necessitates automated monitoring with robots. However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images.

Integrating Motion Planning and Learning 3,Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner: Attention-Guided Sampling for State-Specific Decision Making,"Zhuang, Lei;Zhao, Jingdong;Li, Yuntao;Xu, Zichun;Zhao, Liangliang;Liu, Hong","Keywords: Motion and Path Planning, Deep Learning Methods","Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms are renowned for their robust global search capabilities. However, the inherent randomness in their sampling mechanisms often results in inconsistent path quality and limited search efficiency. In response to these challenges, this work proposes a novel deep learning-based motion planning framework, named Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner (TEMP), which synergizes a Co-Regulation Environmental Information Encoder (CEIE) with a Motion Planning Transformer (MPT). CEIE converts scenario data into encoded environmental information (EEI), providing MPT with an insightful understanding of the environment. MPT leverages an attention mechanism to dynamically recalibrate its focus on EEI, task objectives, and historical planning data, refining the sampling node generation. To demonstrate the capabilities of TEMP, we train our model using a dataset consisting of planning results produced by RRT*. CEIE and MPT are collaboratively trained, enabling CEIE to autonomously learn and extract patterns from environmental data, thereby forming informative representations that MPT can more effectively interpret and utilize for motion planning. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate TEMP's efficacy across diverse dimensions and assess it in out-of-distribution real-world scenarios, demonstrating that TEMP achieves exceptional performance metrics and a heightened degree of generalizability compared to state-of-the-art SBMPs.",,,,,,
Integrating Motion Planning and Learning 3,From Configuration-Space Clearance to Feature-Space Margin: Sample Complexity in Learning-Based Collision Detection,"Tubul, Sapir;Tamar, Aviv;Solovey, Kiril;Salzman, Oren","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Probability and Statistical Methods, Collision Avoidance","Abstract: Motion planning is a central challenge in robotics, with learning-based approaches gaining significant attention in recent years. Our work focuses on a specific aspect of these approaches: using machine-learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate whether robot configurations are collision free, an operation termed Â“collision detectionÂ”. Despite the growing popularity of these methods, there is a lack of theory supporting their efficiency and prediction accuracy. This is in stark contrast to the rich theoretical results of machine-learning methods in general and of SVMs in particular. Our work bridges this gap by analyzing the sample complexity of an SVM classifier for learning-based collision detection in motion planning. We bound the number of samples needed to achieve a specified accuracy at a given confidence level. This result is stated in terms relevant to robot motion planning such as the systemÂ’s clearance. Building on these theoretical results, we propose a collision-detection algorithm that can also provide statistical guarantees on the algorithmÂ’s error in classifying robot configurations as collision-free or not.",,,,,,

However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap.

Integrating Motion Planning and Learning 3,Guiding Long-Horizon Task and Motion Planning with Vision Language Models,"Yang, Zhutian;Garrett, Caelan;Fox, Dieter;Lozano-Perez, Tomas;Kaelbling, Leslie","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Task and Motion Planning, Mobile Manipulation","Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) can generate plausible high-level plans when prompted with a goal, the context, an image of the scene, and any planning constraints. However, there is no guarantee that the predicted actions are geometrically and kinematically feasible for a particular robot embodiment. As a result, many prerequisite steps such as opening drawers to access objects are often omitted. Task and motion planners can generate motion trajectories that respect the geometric feasibility of actions and insert physically necessary actions, but do not scale to everyday problems that require common-sense knowledge and involve large state spaces comprised of many variables. We leverage the VLM for 1) system dynamics (i.e. recipe) and 2) search help. We propose VLM-TAMP, a hierarchical planning algorithm that leverages a VLM to generate intermediate subgoals that guide the sampling of a task and motion planner. When a subgoal or action cannot be refined, the VLM is queried again for replanning. We evaluate VLM-TAMP on kitchen tasks where a robot must accomplish cooking goals that require performing 30-50 actions in sequence and interacting with up to 21 objects. We found that VLM-TAMP substantially outperforms baselines that rigidly and independently execute VLM-generated action sequences (success rate 50 to 100% versus 0%, average task completion percentage 72 to 100% versus 15 to 45%).

Our approach combines generative modelling with inference time optimization to generate sophisticated long-horizon local plans at interactive rates. More specifically, we train a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder to learn a prior over the expert trajectory distribution conditioned on the perception input. At run-time, this is used as an initialization for a sampling-based optimizer for further refinement. Our approach does not require any sophisticated prediction of dynamic obstacles and yet provides state-of-the-art performance.

Integrating Motion Planning and Learning 3,Safe Multi-Agent Navigation Guided by Goal-Conditioned Safe Reinforcement Learning,"Feng, Meng;Parimi, Viraj;Williams, Brian","Keywords: Integrated Planning and Learning, Robot Safety, Reinforcement Learning","Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous environments. Traditional planning methods are effective for solving long-horizon tasks but depend on the availability of a graph representation with predefined distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) is capable of learning complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent then executes by following those waypoints sequentially until their goal locations are reached. This graph pruning and planning approach via the learned value functions allows our approach to flexibly balance the trade-off between faster and safer routes especially over extended horizons.
Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level safe GCRL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safer navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents. Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments.

GM-RL consists of two components: the manipulability estimator and the motion planner. The manipulability estimator employs graph neural networks (GNN) to provide action guidelines based on the dynamic manipulability of the transformable robots. The motion planner generates transformation plans using reinforcement learning (RL). The activation ratio alpha adjusts the ratio of the guideline accepted between the two components. In experiments utilizing a 2-DoF transformable wheel called STEP, GM-RL with alpha=0.5 generated an optimal transformation plan with an average dynamic manipulability measure of 0.0424, the highest measure compared to pure dynamic manipulability and reinforcement learning.

Consequently, many current datasets suffer from quality inconsistencies due to operator variability, highlighting the need for methods to utilize mixed-quality data effectively. To mitigate these issues, we propose ""Select Segments to Imitate"" (S2I), a framework that selects and optimizes mixed-quality demonstration data at the segment level, while ensuring plug-and-play compatibility with existing robotic manipulation policies. The framework has three components: demonstration segmentation dividing origin data into meaningful segments, segment selection using contrastive learning to find high-quality segments, and trajectory optimization to refine suboptimal segments for better policy learning. We evaluate S2I through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments across six tasks, demonstrating that with only 3 expert demonstrations for reference, S2I can improve the performance of various downstream policies when trained with mixed-quality demonstrations.

This paper focuses on data augmentation methods in imitation learning. Imitation learning consists of three stages: data collection from experts, learning model, and execution. However, collecting expert data requires manual effort and is time-consuming. Additionally, as sensors have different data acquisition intervals, preprocessing such as downsampling to match the lowest frequency is necessary. Downsampling enables data augmentation and also contributes to the stabilization of robot operations. In light of this background, this paper proposes the Data Augmentation Method for Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning with Images, called ""DABI"". DABI collects robot joint angles, velocities, and torques at 1000 Hz, and uses images from gripper and environmental cameras captured at 100 Hz as the basis for data augmentation. This enables a tenfold increase in data. In this paper, we collected just 5 expert demonstration datasets. We trained the bilateral control Bi-ACT model with the unaltered dataset and two augmentation methods for comparative experiments and conducted real-world experiments.

To enhance feature fusion in MDConv, we introduce an attention mechanism and design an efficient multi-feature fusion (EMFF) module suitable for both 3D and 2D sparse features.To improve segmentation accuracy, we design a point-voxel constraint (PVC) module to handle edge voxels containing multiple point cloud categories, optimizing the final inference results. These modules add minimal memory and inference time but significantly improve performance compared to the baseline. Extensive experiments benchmarks on SemanticKITTI achieve excellent performance, while supplementary experiments on nuScenes also yield good results, demonstrating the superiority of MDC-Seg.

Autonomous Vehicle Perception 7,Illumination Adaptation for SAM to Achieve Accurate Segmentation of Images Taken in Low-Light Scenes,"Mu, Hongmin;Zhou, MengChu;Cao, Zhengcai","Keywords: Semantic Scene Understanding, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Deep Learning for Visual Perception","Abstract: Achieving accurate segmentation in low-light scenes is challenging due to 1) severe domain shift encountered when models trained on daylight data are applied to such scenes and 2) lack of large-scale fine-grained labels in low-light conditions. A good idea is to use the generalization capabilities of segmentation foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) to address the scarcity of annotated data. However, applying SAM to low-light scenes faces a severe domain shift issue due to the lack of inductive bias in effectively transforming low-light features into natural-light ones. To address this issue, we propose to adapt SAM for low-light scenes. To reduce the reliance on labels of low-light data, we develop a self-training method that makes SAM generate source-free predictions. To reduce the domain gap between low-light target data and SAM's natural-light trained data, we design a transformation head that enhances low-light features prior to the application of SAM. We further propose a domain shift compensation loss that trains our model to select a domain-adaptation-optimal illumination-enhanced feature map. Experimental results demonstrate that our method well outperforms the state of the art on the Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Perception 7,4DRadDet: Cluster-Queried Enhanced 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar,"Weng, Caien;Bi, Xin;Tong, Panpan;Eichberger, Arno","Keywords: Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Computer Vision for Automation","Abstract: 3D object detection plays a critical role in advancing autonomous driving technology. To improve perception capabilities while maintaining low costs and ensuring performance in adverse weather conditions, 4D radar has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D object detection. However, current methods fail to fully exploit raw data and density information of 4D radar point clouds to tackle challenges like sparse data and noise. To address these limitations and make use of the unique Doppler velocity information provided by 4D radar, we propose a novel approach called 4DRadDet, which uses cross-attention fusion with cluster-queried techniques for 3D object detection. The 4DRadDet model uses a specially designed incremental clustering method to cluster potential object point clouds, reducing measurement errors from limited radar angular resolution and signal multipath effects. The cross-attention feature fusion (CAFF) module enhances network performance by querying the clustered point cloud feature map, allowing the network to leverage reliable prior information from the clustered point cloud to better detect potential objects. Our experimental evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of 4DRadDet, showcasing state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, 4DRadDet achieves a 3D mean average precision (mAP3D) of 51.44% and a bird's-eye view mean average precision (mAPBEV) of 57.07%. Our proposed method demonstrates impressive inference times and achieves real-time detection capabilities.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Perception 7,Robust Visual Localization System with HD Map Based on Joint Probabilistic Data Association,"Gu, Zizhen;Cheng, Shaowu;Wang, Chuan;Wang, Ruihan;Zhao, Yong","Keywords: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Vision-Based Navigation, Localization","Abstract: Localization based on a high-definition (HD) map is a pivotal technology for autonomous driving. Nonetheless, establishing precise data association (DA) between detected landmarks and map landmarks presents a formidable challenge when leveraging prior information on maps. Traditional DA algorithms relying on nearest-neighbor methods only partially mitigate the ambiguity in DA caused by missed or false detections from the perception module, especially in complex and challenging environments. In this letter, we propose a novel joint probability data association (JPDA) algorithm. By integrating joint probability encompassing semantic likelihood, local spatial likelihood, and global structural likelihood of landmarks, alongside incorporating inter-frame temporal continuity of DA, the proposed algorithm can effectively rectify the erroneous DA. Additionally, we also introduce a max-mixture factor graph optimization framework, which couples the measurements of landmarks and odometry for pose estimation. Building upon these methods, a high-precision and robust visual semantic localization system employing consumer-level sensors has been developed. Experiments conducted on public datasets and real urban roads validate the efficacy of the proposed system in providing more robust and accurate localization results for autonomous driving vehicles.",,,,,,
Autonomous Vehicle Perception 7,SALON: Self-Supervised Adaptive Learning for Off-Road Navigation,"Sivaprakasam, Matthew;Triest, Samuel;Ho, Cherie;Aich, Shubhra;Lew, Jeric Jieyi;Adu, Isaiah;Wang, Wenshan;Scherer, Sebastian","Keywords: Vision-Based Navigation, Learning from Experience, Field Robots","Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation in off-road environments presents a number of challenges due to its lack of structure, making it difficult to handcraft robust heuristics for diverse scenarios. While learned methods using hand labels or self-supervised data improve generalizability, they often require a tremendous amount of data and can be vulnerable to domain shifts. To improve generalization in novel environments, recent works have incorporated adaptation and self-supervision to develop autonomous systems that can learn from their own experiences online. However, current works often rely on significant prior data, for example minutes of human teleoperation data for each terrain type, which is difficult to scale with more environments and robots. To address these limitations, we propose SALON, a perception-action framework for textit{fast} adaptation of traversability estimates with textit{minimal} human input. SALON rapidly learns online from experience while avoiding out of distribution terrains to produce adaptive and risk-aware cost and speed maps. Within textit{seconds} of collected experience, our results demonstrate comparable navigation performance over kilometer-scale courses in diverse off-road terrain as methods trained on 100-1000x more data. We additionally show promising results on significantly different robots in different environments. Our code is available at https://theairlab.org/SALON.",,,,,,
